TIRUPPUR (TAMIL NADU) : Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday slammed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for its 'male dominance' and said it is 'unfortunate' that the 'organisation' that controls India today is fascist and male chauvinist.
 Answering a question during his interaction with industrial labourers at Ramasamy Muthammal Thirumana Mandapam, here, former Congress president said that RSS discriminated against the women and doesn't respect them.
 "I agree that without giving equal place to women no country can progress.
 Unfortunately, the organisation that controls India today is a fascist, male chauvinist organisation.
 Women are not allowed in the RSS," he said.
 "They (RSS) discriminate against women from the beginning.
 Any organisation that doesn't let women in it obviously doesn't respect women.
 If you respected women, you would have given them equal space in your organisation," he added.
 He further took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not having public interactions often, and said, "I am speaking to you, taking questions from you.
 Have you ever seen PM doing that?" "He will sit in one room with five people, biggest business people in the country and will discuss with them.
 He will never discuss with farmers, workers, small business people what they think," the Wayanad MP said.
 He termed the farm laws passed by the Centre as 'demonetisation' for farmers.
 "Farm laws are like demonetisation for farmers.
 I'm very proud to see that they're sitting outside Delhi and not allowing Narendra Modi to implement them.
 He doesn't understand the power of the poor and our job is to make him understand the power of the poor, workers and farmers," the Congress leader stated.
 He added that a systematic and organised assault is taking place on workers and poor people of this country.
 "Don't think that these are policy mistakes.
 These are things that are done on purpose to break the backbone of Indian workers and Indian small and medium businesses," he said further.
 Gandhi is on a three-day visit to the western belt in Tamil Nadu and will have interactions with farmers, weavers, and the general public.
 He will also visit Tiruppur, Erode, Karur and Dindigul districts between January 23 to 25.

NEW DELHI: Seven more states will be administering the indigenously-developed Covaxin from next week, the health ministry said on Saturday.
 The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had earlier this month approved Oxford Covid-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for a massive inoculation drive.
 Addressing a media briefing, additional secretary in the Union health ministry Manohar Agnani said that as on January 23, a total of 15,37,190 beneficiaries have been vaccinated for Covid-19 in 27,776 sessions.
 The inoculation drive was launched on January 16 with over three crore healthcare and frontline workers prioritised to get the jabs initially.
 In addition to the 12 states currently using Covaxin, seven new states -- Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and West Bengal -- will be administering the vaccine from next week, Agnani said.
 "The orientation of all programme managers of these seven states was conducted today by the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) and the health ministry covering all aspects of implementation protocols," he said.
 Giving updates on the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive, he said that "1,46,598 beneficiaries were vaccinated till 6 pm today and 123 adverse event following immunisation were reported till 6 pm on the eighth day of the vaccination drive.
" No case of serious or severe adverse event following immunisation or death attributable to vaccination has been reported till date, the official said.
 "Total six deaths have been reported so far (post-vaccination).
 In the last 24 hours, a person aged 56 years, a resident of Gurgaon, has died.
 The postmortem confirms that cardio-pulmonary disease was the reason for her death and it was not related to vaccination.
 None of these deaths have been causally linked with Covid-19 vaccination," he said.
 Agnani said 11 hospitalisations post vaccinations have been reported till date.
 "About 0.
0007 per cent people have recorded hospitalisation against vaccinations.
 In the last 24 hours, one person has been hospitalised at a government hospital in Guntur in Andhra Pradesh who was vaccinated on January 20," he said.
 Agnani said a training of Immunization Programme Managers of 13 countries -- Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brazil, Maldives, Mauritius, Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Seychelles and Sri Lanka -- using Indian vaccines was conducted by the health ministry, covering all aspects of vaccine roll-out, over two days.

NEW DELHI: With assembly elections in West Bengal months away, Kolkata turned into a political battleground on the 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Subhas Chandra Bose as the ruling Trinamool and the BJP went all out to appropriate the legacy of Netaji.
 While the BJP celebrated the day as "Parakram Diwas", the TMC observed it as "Desh Nayak Diwas".
 TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee kicked off the celebrations with a grand procession in Kolkata.
 Before the commencement of the 7-km procession from Syambazar area in the northern part of the city, Banerjee blew a conch shell and a siren was sounded at 12.
15 pm, the time when Bose was born on this day in 1897.
 She took a dig at the BJP for remembering Netaji only at the time of elections.
 'Don't insult': Mamata refuses to give speech at Netaji event after sloganeering in PM Modi's presence"We do not celebrate Netaji's birthday only in the years when elections are scheduled.
 We are celebrating his 125th birth anniversary in a grand fashion," she said.
 The BJP glitz, on the other hand, was led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who visited the city and spoke about the "new India" that is taking shape today.
 PM Modi wondered how this new India would have made Netaji proud.
 "Netaji had dreamt of strong India, from LAC to LOC we are following his footsteps.
 Whenever our sovereignty was challenged, we have given a befitting reply," PM Modi said at an event organised at Victoria Memorial.
 The Prime Minister said that Netaji is the biggest source of inspiration for the dream of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-reliant India) and 'Sonar Bangla' (Golden Bengal).
 "Netaji would have been proud that the government he dreamt of is fighting a pandemic with vaccines developed by it," Modi said.
 Referring to the question that Netaji had asked his nephew Sisir Bose before his daring escape from house arrest, Modi said, "If today Indians place their hands on their hearts and feel Netaji's presence, they will hear the same question: Will you do something for me? This task is to make India self-reliant.
" Noting that Netaji had identified poverty, illiteracy and diseases among the biggest problems of the country, he said the society will have to come together to solve these problems.
 "Bengal needs to play an important role in the quest for Aatmnirbhar Bharat, just like the role that Netaji played in the freedom of the country.
 Aatmnirbhar Bharat has to be led by Aatamnirbhar Bengal and Sonar Bangla," he said.
 Hailing Netaji as the embodiment of India's power and inspiration, Modi said that the country has decided to celebrate the freedom fighter's birth anniversary as 'Parakram Diwas' to honour his indomitable spirit and selfless service to the nation.
 Mamata on the other hand fired several salvos at the Centre as she paid homage to Bose at his ancestral home.
 The West Bengal chief minister criticised the Centre for abolishing the Planning Commission, which, according to her, was conceptualised by Netaji.
 "Why the national Planning Commission, which was conceptualised by Netaji in independent India, was dissolved? Why the demand for a national holiday on Netaji's birthday by our government has not been yet met?" Mamata said in her brief speech at Netaji Bhawan.
 "A monument, named after Azad Hind Fauj, will be erected at Rajarhat.
 A university named after Netaji is also being set up which shall be funded entirely by the state, and will have tie-ups with foreign universities," she tweeted.
 She also asked, "Who has given the name 'Parakram'? We are celebrating the day as 'Deshnayak Diwas' here because it has a history.
 Rabindranath Tagore had described Netaji as 'Deshnayak'.
 That is why we have today used the name to link the two legends of Bengal," she added.

GUWAHATI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday came down heavily on those criticising the efficacies of Covid-19 vaccines, asserting that there should be no politics on public health.
 Addressing a function to extend the benefit of the government's healthcare programme to the central armed police forces, he said the vaccines developed by Indian scientists are fully safe.
 "There are some people who are spreading misinformation on the vaccines.
 Come to another platform and let's have a duel.
 But why are you creating doubt over people's health and doing politics?" he asked.
 "I appeal to all of you to go for the vaccine when your turn comes.
 Do not have any doubt over its efficacy.
 We've already launched the world's biggest vaccination drive," he added.
 Shah ceremoniously distributed the 'Ayushman CAPF' health cards among some personnel from the seven Central Armed Police Forces here.
 He said the CAPFs had three prime concerns -- the existing health coverage was not comprehensive, the satisfaction of housing was not there and long duty hours without leaves due to non-timely recruitment.
 "Our government is addressing all the three concerns.
 For the health issue, we've launched the 'Ayushman CAPF' today.
 This will give health insurance benefit to around 50 lakh people," Shah said.
 By May 1, the 'Ayushman CAPF' process will be completed by offering health cards to all the personnel of the seven central police forces, he added.
 The home minister said the government and the forces are trying to increase the satisfaction ratio to 55 per cent by 2022 from 36 per cent two years ago, and further take it to 65 per cent by 2025.
 "We've completed the examination process for 50,000 recruitments.
 Now, we'll start the process again to hire another 50,000 persons in the CAPFs.
 Our target is one hiring against one departure in five years.
 With this, everyone will be able to stay home for 100 days in a year," he added.
 An MoU was signed between the National Health Authority (NHA) and Union Home Ministry in presence of Shah, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai and state Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at the CRPF Group Centre in Guwahati.
 Under the initiative 'Ayushman CAPF', around 28 lakh personnel from Central Armed Police Force (CAPF), Assam Rifles and NSG and their families will be covered by the 'Ayushman Bharat: Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana'.
 CRPF Director-General AP Maheshwari expressed his gratitude for bringing the CAPFs under the scheme.
 The Home minister also virtually inaugurated Sashastra Seema Bal's (SSB) 168 quarters, a 10-bed hospital and an administrative building located at different places of Assam.

JODHPUR: Eight Rafale aircraft have already arrived in India and three more are expected by the end of this month, Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria said here on Saturday.
 The IAF chief was speaking at a press conference after the conclusion of 'Exercise Desert Knight-21' held in Jodhpur by the air forces of India and France.
 He said IAF has initiated a fifth-generation fighter aircraft programme with the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) and plans to incorporate some sixth-generation capabilities in it as well.
 "Our present vision is to incorporate all the latest technologies and sensors in our fifth-generation aircraft," Bhadauria said.
 "We started work on fifth-generation aircraft a little late.
 So technologies and sensors contemporary to that period of development would be added into fifth-generation fighters," he added.
 Bhadauria said when IAF received the Rafale aircraft, the first priority was to operationalise it and integrate it with the existing combat fleet.
 "It has already been done, and the current exercise Desert Knight was the result of that," he said.
 "We have some Indian pilots training in France and some in India itself.
 We have enough pilots to have a right pilot-cockpit ratio," the Air Chief Marshal said, adding that the entire induction would be completed by next year.
 Earlier, Bhadauria congratulated both the air forces for successfully completing the exercise in just four days.
 Desert Knight-21 was scheduled to be held over five days.
 "It is not in terms of interoperability which has been learnt in this exercise, but employment of best practices, operational philosophies and mutual as well as professional interaction," he said.
 Later, talking to the media, French Ambassador to India Emmanuel Lenain said bilateral cooperation between the two countries has been going on ever since the first French aircraft landed in India in 1953.
 "Now Rafale is the reflection of this strengthened cooperation and partnership," Lenain said.
 He said this partnership has persisted through good and bad times.
 "When India faced difficulties during its atomic test in Pokran in 1998, we were at your side while other countries opposed and objected.
 And we were also by your side in cooperational manner when you had difficulties with one of your neighbours," the ambassador said.
 He said this exercise would further help in building mutual trust and pave the way for more cooperation.

NEW DELHI: Former union minister M J Akbar on Saturday reiterated before a Delhi court that the allegations of sexual misconduct made by journalist Priya Ramani against him were "fabricated and false".
  Akbar made the submission before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar through senior advocate Geeta Luthra during the final hearing in a criminal complaint filed by him against Ramani for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct decades ago.
  Ramani had made the allegation of sexual misconduct against Akbar in 2018 during the #MeToo movement.
  Luthra said that Ramani "removing the tweet when the matter was sub-judice was (in) bad faith".
  "You (Ramani) can't make allegations on social media without any care and caution or responsibility after 20-30 years," she said.
  She added that after first saying that "Akbar didn't do anything, you call him media's biggest predator".
  Luthra argued that Ramani had raised contradictory defence.
  "You didn't feel the requirement of evidence of landline record, hotel, petrol receipt, CCTV.
 It (Ramani's claim of Akbar's sexual misconduct in a hotel) is complete hearsay, fabricated and false," Luthra said  She said that Nilofer, Ramani's friend and a key witness in the case, was not an eyewitness.
  The court will further hear the matter on January 27.
  Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018.
 He resigned as union minister on October 17, 2018.
  Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as "media's biggest predator" that harmed his reputation.
  He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment he faced from the women who came forward during the #MeToo campaign.
  Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.
  He termed the allegations "false, fabricated and deeply distressing" and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.

COIMBATORE: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the his party is committed to reconceptualising the Goods and Services Tax regime if voted to power at the Centre and assured ushering in a 'One tax, minimum tax.
' The current tax system has crippled the Medium Small and Micro Enterprises, he said in an interaction with industry representatives here.
 The Congress leader, who began his campaign for the Tamil Nadu assembly polls, said there was the need to promote MSMEs, to compete with countries like China and Bangladesh.
 "In my mind the future of India and any competition we want to win with China, Bangladesh or others is through the MSMEs," he said.
 Small and medium industry was the backbone of job creation, he said and blamed the Centre for creating 'huge disharmony' in the country.
 "You cannot have disharmony and have economic growth," he said and alleged India is unable to provide jobs and the economy has been devastated.
 Answering a participant on GST, he hit out at the Modi-led government for bypassing a bulk of negotiations that took place during the UPA rule for a simple, minimum tax.
 Eventually, the BJP government 'superimposed' its own model deviating from the originally conceptualised framework and as a result, people paid 'five' (in reference to slabs) massive amount of taxes and faced huge complications too, he alleged.
 He assured restructuring the GST to pave the way for 'one tax, minimum tax," if his party was voted to power at the Centre.
 "This GST regime will simply not work.
 It will impose huge load on MSMEs and cripple our economic system.
 The biggest supporters of GST were large businesses.
 There is a reason for it.
 GST.
.
.
 as it is currently designed to help them and not MSMEs," Gandhi said.
 His party and the United Progressive Alliance were committed to reconceptualising and restructuring the GST for a one tax and minimum tax.
 "When we come to power in Delhi we will restructure the GST and give you one tax, minimum tax," he said.
 MSMEs should be truly empowered and they should have access to credit, he said adding the government cannot tie the hands of industries with ,'GST and demonetisation' and ask them to compete with China.
 There was the need to simplify GST and other norms for the benefit of MSMEs.
 "Without unclogging the banking system, without giving the MSMEs protection and incentives for job creation, the Indian economic system will not move forward," he said.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Saturday gave its nod to protesting farmers to hold 100-km tractor parade on Republic Day in the national capital, farmer leaders claimed.
 The tractor parades will start from the Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri border points of Delhi, but details will be finalised tonight, farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar said after attending a meeting between the unions and the police.
 Thousands of farmers will participate in the parade, there will be no single route, farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni said.
 Meanwhile, Delhi police has said that the protesting farmers have not given them anything in writing regarding the route of proposed tractor rally.
 "When the protesting farmers would give us in writing about the route of the proposed tractor rally on January 26, we will analyse it and take a decision," Delhi police said.
 Farmer Unions also claimed that the Delhi police will remove the barricades set up at border points on January 26 and the farmers will return to border points after the tractor rally.
 "The rally will be completely peaceful.
 There wonât be any disruption to any official function on that day," farmer leaders said.
 The government's negotiations with representatives of thousands of protesting farmers hit a roadblock after the farmer unions rejected the Centre's proposal to put three farm laws on hold.
 Farmer leaders have said that they would settle for nothing less than a complete repeal of the laws, enacted in September last year, which they find pro-corporate, and a legal guarantee for the procurement of crops at government-fixed MSP (minimum support price).

MUMBAI: The credit for the BJP's political growth in Maharashtra goes to late Bal Thackeray and the Shiv Sena, party MP Sanjay Raut said on Saturday.
 Speaking to reporters after paying tributes to the Sena founder on the occasion of his 95th birth anniversary at his memorial in ShivajiPark in central Mumbai, Raut said the BJP would not have been able to expand its base in rural areas of Maharashtra if Sena had not aligned with that party.
 "The credit for the rise of today's BJP goes to Balasaheb.
 If Shiv Sena takes a different political stand in the interest of the country and Maharashtra, that doesn't mean the party has deviated from his (Bal Thackeray's) ideology," Raut said, in a veiled swipe at the BJP.
 The Shiv Sena used to be one of the oldest allies of the BJP in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) before it walked out of the fold in 2019 while accusing its former ally of not honouring a pre-poll promise in Maharashtra.
 In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena-BJP government had first come to power in 1995.
 Both the parties again shared power, though with changed equations, from 2014 to 2019 with Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP being at the helm, before they fell out after the 2019 Assembly polls on the issue of sharing the post of chief minister.
 Since then, the BJP has been accusing the Sena, which shares power with ideologically incompatible NCP and Congress in the state, of diluting Bal Thackeray's ideology of Hindutva for the sake of power.
 "Every party needs to take a political stand in the interest of that particular state, the country and its people.
 What is important is staying that course and succedding.
.
.
and the Shiv Sena has done that," he said.
 Raut, also the chief spokesperson of the Sena, said Bal Thackeray would have been happy with the way the Sena and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) are working in the state.
 "Uddhav Thackeray is a popular chief minister in India.
.
.
.
 Balasaheb would have been happy," he added.
 Raut said that Bal Thackeray's "ideology" was that all parties should go beyond politics and come together in the interest of the state Several Sena leaders, including film actor Urmila Matondkar who joined the Uddhav Thackeray-led party recently, paid their tributes.

NEW DELHI: India too can be aggressive if Beijing tries to get aggressive along the Line of Actual Control, Indian Air Force Chief (IAF) Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Saturday amid the ongoing Ladakh border standoff.
 Addressing a press conference on the sidelines of IAF and the French Air and Space Force's bilateral exercise 'Desert Knight-21', Bhadauria said, "If they can be aggressive, we can also be aggressive.
 We are fully prepared.
" On being asked if similar exercises are also being conducted at the Eastern border, Bhadauria said, "The bilateral exercises are not part of exercises against any country.
 It is to develop capability and improve bilateral ties.
" The Air Chief Marshal said that the present vision is to incorporate all the latest technologies and sensors in our fifth-generation aircraft.
 IAF till now has inducted eight of the 36 Rafales, which are also capable of delivering nuclear weapons, under the Rs 59,000 crore deal inked with France in September 2016.
 3 more Rafale fighters touch down in IndiaThe IAF chief said that eight Rafale fighter jets have arrived in India and three will come by the end of the month.

KOLKATA: Slamming the central government for allegedly 'destroying' the 'federal structure', West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said there will be befitting 'reaction' for every 'wrong action'.
 Addressing an event celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose here, Banerjee said, "Netaji endorsed Tagore's Jana Gana Mana as the National Anthem.
 They are trying to play with the National Anthem.
 We will not tolerate this.
 If you do good we will listen to it.
 But if you do the wrong action, we will show the reaction.
" "Netaji envisioned the Planning Commission.
 I used to go to the Planning Commission to discuss policies.
 Today there is no space for discussion.
 The federal structure is destroyed.
 We demand the National Planning Commission must be brought back," claimed Mamata Bannerjee.
 She said Netaji constituted the Indian National Army with people from all the regions and religions.
 "Netaji stood against the divide and rule policy of the British.
 History cannot be written in new forms.
 We want a united India," she added.
 The chief minister said there should be four capitals in India and the demand regarding this will be raised in Parliament.
 "One nation, one political party will not work," she said.
 On Centre's decision to celebrate Netaji's birthday as 'Parakram Diwas', Banerjee reacted saying, "What is Parakram? They should at least consult me or Sougata Bose or any other, about which word to use.
 We will celebrate the day as Desh Nayak Diwas.
" She explained that Rabindranath Tagore addressed Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose 'Desh Nayak'.
 She also announced about building Azad Hind Monument.
 "It feels sad that the Centre has not yet declared a holiday on Netaji's birthday.
 We will build the Azad Hind Monument.
 We will show how it will be done.
 They have spent thousands of crores of rupees in building a new parliament complex without any present requirement," pointed out Banerjee.
 Before the event, Mamata Banerjee led a march from Shyam Bazaar to Red Road in Kolkata.
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited Netaji Bhawan at Elgin Road in Kolkata today.
 The Prime Minister will preside over the inaugural function of the 'Parakram Diwas' celebrations at Victoria Memorial in Kolkata.
 In order to honour and remember Netaji's indomitable spirit and selfless service to the nation, the Government of India has decided to celebrate his birthday on January 23 every year as 'Parakram Diwas' to inspire people of the country, especially the youth, to act with fortitude in the face of adversity as Netaji did, and to infuse in them a spirit of patriotic fervour.
 Born to advocate Janakinath Bose in Odisha's Cuttack on January 23, 1897, Netaji went on to play a key role in the freedom movement.
 He is also known for establishing the Azad Hind Fauj.

KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said India should have four capitals on a rotation basis and sessions of Parliament should be held in different locations in the country.
 She also slammed the Centre for its decision to observe January 23 as 'Parakram Diwas' to commemorate the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and said the Narendra Modi government did not consult with her before announcing it.
 "During the British-era, Kolkata was the capital of the country.
 I think we must have four capitals on a rotation basis.
 Why does the country have only one capital? And the sessions of Parliament should be held in different places in the country.
 We will have to change our concept," she said while addressing a gathering here after participating in a grand procession to pay tribute to Netaji's 125th birth anniversary.
 She also questioned why will the birth anniversary of Bose not be celebrated as 'Deshnayak Diwas'.
 "What is the meaning of 'Parakram'? They may dislike me politically but could have consulted with me.
 They could have consulted with Netaji's great-grandsons Sugata Bose or Sumantra Bose on choosing a word," Banerjee said.
 She also asked, "Who has given the name 'Parakram'? But we are celebrating the day as 'Deshnayak Diwas' here because it has a history.
 Rabindranath Tagore had described Netaji as 'Deshnayak'.
 That is why we have today used the name to link the two legends of Bengal," she added.
 Before the commencement of the 7-km procession from Syambazar area in the northern part of the city, Banerjee blew a conch shell and a siren was sounded at 12.
15 pm, the time when Bose was born on this day in 1897.
 "We do not celebrate Netaji's birthday only in the years when elections are scheduled.
 We are celebrating his 125th birth anniversary in a grand fashion," she said.
 Banerjee also alleged that there is a "game" going on to change the country's national anthem - "Jana Gana Mana".
 "There is a game going on to change our national anthem.
 Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had endorsed 'Jana Gana Mana' as the national anthem.
 We will not allow to change it," she said.
 Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore wrote "Jana Gana Mana" in 1911 in Bengali and it was adopted as the national anthem in 1950.
 However, the national anthem is only a part of the poem penned and composed by Tagore.
 Criticising the Centre for abolishing the Planning Commission, she said the Niti Aayog and the plan panel can co-exist.
 "He (Netaji) had also spoken about the Planning Commission and several other things.
 I do not have any idea why the Planning Commission was abolished.
 Niti Aayog and the Planning Commission can co-exist.
 You will have to bring back the national Planning Commission," she added.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Kolkata on Saturday afternoon to take part in the 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
 To honour and remember Netaji's selfless service to the nation, the government had declared Netaji's birthday on January 23 as 'Parakram Diwas'.
 In Kolkata, PM Modi participated in a programme at the Victoria Memorial, visited Netaji Bhavan, Bose's residence and also met with artists and delegates attending an international seminar on Bose at the National Library.
 PM Modi's few-hour long visit to Kolkata on Netaji's birth anniversary holds significance ahead of assembly elections in West Bengal scheduled in April-May this year.
 In West Bengal, BJP is in direct contest with the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), who has also tried to claim the legacy of Bose, India's foremost freedom fighter.
 Here are the top quotes from PM Modi's address: * Whenever I heard Netaji's name, irrespective of the situation, I felt inspired.
 * Today, I bow to Netaji.
 I bow the man who stood up to the world's biggest imperial force and declared that he won't ask for freedom but will fight for it.

 (Credit: ANI)* The country has decided that now every year we will celebrate Netaji's birth anniversary, i.
e.
 January 23, as 'Parakram Divas'.
 * It is my good fortune that in 2018 we named the island of Andaman as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island.
 * Realizing the spirit of the country, the files related to Netaji were also made public by our government.
 * It was the good fortune of our government that members of the Indian National Army (INA) participated in the veterans' parade on Republic Day.
 BJP government has announced to celebrate Netaji's birth anniversary as Parakram Diwas.
 (Credit:ANI)*Before leaving India, Netaji asked his nephew Shishir a question, "Can you do something for me".
 Netaji's decision to hurt the imperialists from outside of India was one of the primary reasons why the British empire's hold on India loosened.
 * Every person in India is indebted to Netaji.
 Every drop of blood flowing in the body of more than 130 crores Indians is indebted to Netaji Subhash.
 * Today citizens have to do something for India.
 We have to become aatmanirnbhar.
 We have to manufacture world-class products.
 There was nothing stopping India from becoming aatmanirbhar.
 PM Modi and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee at Victoria Memorial.
 (Credit: ANI)* Netaji would be happy to see India acing in world's most advanced technologies and to see Indian Army well-equipped with fighter jets like Rafale.
 * The world is seeing the avatar of a strong India that Netaji envisioned from the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to Line Of Control (LoC).
 * Netaji would feel proud of India leading in coronavirus vaccine development.
 * There is a lot to talk about Netaji.
 But one thing in particular that I always remember about him is his indomitable spirit.
 He said other countries might have bowed to imperialists but we won't.
 * Netaji used to find inspiration from Bhagwat Gita.
 * Netaji is not only an inspiration for an aatmanirbhar Bharat but is also an inspiration for Bengal who will continue to struggle to fulfil Netaji's vision.

NEW DELHI: A year after China imposed the world's first coronavirus lockdown in Wuhan, life has largely returned to normal in the city of 11 million.
 However, the rest of the world continues to grapples with the spread of the virus' more contagious variants.
 Efforts to vaccinate people for Covid-19 have been frustrated by disarray and limited supplies in some places.
 The scourge has killed more than 2 million people worldwide.
 We look at how the virus has unfolded in the last one year since the Wuhan lockdown.
   There have been over 98 million cases across the world.
 Barring few island nations in the Pacific, the virus has spread to every part of the world.
 Many countries are currently witnessing second, in some cases even third, the wave of coronavirus.
 In Europe, leaders are struggling to counter a surge in new cases and rising fatalities.
 Several regions have reimposed restrictions on the movement of people.
   The US with 17 million cases continued to grapple with latest surge in virus cases.
 In India, the number of cases crossed the 10 million mark earlier this month.
 In the UK, the new variant has once again necessiated the need for reimposition of strict lockdown measures.
 Countries across the world were bringing in new measures, including the Netherlands, which was set to introduce its first curfew since World War II.
   In the United States, the world's worst-hit country, President Joe Biden gave his highest estimate yet of its eventual toll, as he stepped up federal aid.
 "The virus is surging," President Biden told a news conference.
 "We're at 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000.
" In Britain, another 1,401 fatalities were announced Friday, taking the overall toll to 95,981 â the highest in Europe.
 Virus deaths have risen 16% over the past week, while the number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 is approaching double the number seen during the worst days of the first wave of the pandemic in April.
   Across the world, the US has so far given shot to the highest number of people followed by China.
 While over 17 million people have received shot in the US, 15 million have been administered with coronavirus vaccine shots in China.
 Other than India, Russia, Spain, Turkey, Italy, Germany, UAE, Israel, UK, China and the US have all completed over one million Covid-19 shots.
 The Covid-19 immunisation programme is currently underway in 50 countries.
 As of January 21, over 57 million Covid-19 vaccine shots have been administered across the world.
  âââ The worldwide lockdown caused severe stress on all the major world economies.
 In India, the GDP contracted by 23.
9%.
 Tens of millions of people are at the risk of falling into extreme poverty.
 The World Health Organisation expects the number of undernourished people could increase by up to 132 million.
 Thousands of enterprises across the world are facing an existential crisis, resulting in job losses for millions of people.
 The world body estimated that nearly half of the 3.
3 billion working population of the world is at the risk of losing their livelihood.

 She also demanded that Netaji's birthday on January 23 be declared a national holiday.
 "Why the national Planning Commission, which was conceptualised by Netaji in independent India, was dissolved? Why the demand for a holiday on Netaji's birthday by our government not yet met?" Banerjee said in her brief speech.
 The Narendra Modi government disbanded the Planning Commission in 2014 and had formed the Niti Aayog.
 Banerjee said, "We don't remember Netaji before the elections.
 He is in our hearts for 365 days.
 We are in touch with his family.
" She also said Netaji was described as 'Deshnayak' by Rabindranath Tagore.
 "We are celebrating his birthday day as Deshnayak Diwas," Banerjee added.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said that India must have four rotating capitals.
 Addressing a rally on the occasion of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's 125th rally, Mamata said, "I believe that India must have four rotating capitals.
 The English ruled the entire country from Kolkata.
 Why should there be only one capital city in our country.

 Parakram Diwas celebrations live updatesHere are the key points from Mamata's speech today:*We are celebrating Netaji's birthday day as Deshnayak Diwas.
 The Central government will have to declare Netaji's birthday as a national holiday.
 * Centre did not consult with me while declaring Netaji's birthday as 'Parakram Diwas'.
 * Do you know why we celebrate the day as 'Deshnayak Diwas'? It is because Rabindranath Tagore used to call Netaji by that.
.
.
 Netaji should be understood with emotions.
 * There were very few people who had the same amount of love for their motherland as him.
 Though we all know his birthday, we are unaware of the details of his death.
 * Why was the National Planning Commission, which was conceptualised by Netaji in independent India, dissolved? * Why has the demand for a holiday on Netaji's birthday not yet been fulfilled? * We don't remember Netaji only before the elections.
 He is in our hearts 365 days.

KOLKATA: With political parties apprehending violence and unrest in poll-bound West Bengal, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora on Friday said the commission has zero-tolerance to money and muscle power and misuse of the government machinery.
 The CEC also said no civic police volunteers will be deployed for the upcoming assembly elections in the state.
 "The commission has zero-tolerance to money and muscle power or misuse of government machinery," the CEC told reporters here.
 He said the EC's expenditure observer will take steps to prevent misuse of money power.
 The full bench of the ECI, which is currently in the state to review preparedness for the assembly polls due in April-May, held meetings with representatives of political parties, senior government officials and police officers.
 Asked about incidents of violence ahead of the assembly elections in the state, Arora said, "We would like to review events of serious crimes which have political overtones and examine them on a case-to-case basis.
" To a related question about the EC taking action against those involved in incidents of hurling stones at political meetings and processions, the CEC said, "The commission can act only after the election dates are announced.
 We will take a series of measures and not allow bike rallies after the model code of conduct comes into force.
" About the possibility of early deployment of central security personnel in the state ahead of the elections, Arora said, "I don't know who gave you the idea that we are going to deploy forces two-three months before the polls.
 We will go by our standard operating procedure and deploy them as and when necessary.
 "We take into account all the issues.
 Forces will be deployed in advance as per our final assessment.
" Claiming that West Bengal is witnessing political violence in the run-up to the elections, opposition parties have urged the full bench of the ECI to ensure that free and fair polls are held in the state.
 The ruling Trinamool Congress alleged that the BSF is threatening people in the border areas of the state to cast their votes in favour of a particular political party.
 The Border Security Force, however, denied the TMC's allegation, saying that it was "baseless" and "far from the truth".
 Describing the allegation against the BSF as "unfortunate", Arora said it is one of the finest forces in the country.
 He said the political party concerned should come up with facts to support its allegation.
 West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh had said that names of Rohingya Muslims have been included in voters' list in the state and urged the ECI to facilitate scrutiny of it.
 The EC has been requested to look into allegations of irregularities in the process of updating the list, he said.
 Asked about the BJP's demand to facilitate scrutiny of the voters' roll, the CEC said, "We are giving you (media) the complete list.
 Now you check yourself.
 Not just in Bengal, our officers take a closer look at the list.
 If there is an issue, we take it up.
" Several parties voiced concerns over law and order situation in the state, while issues like fake news on social media and provocative slogans with communal overtone have also been flagged by them, the CEC said.
 Asked about allegations that a large number of electors were not allowed to cast their votes in the 2018 Panchayat polls, Arora said the State Election Commission conducts the polls to the local bodies.
 "The ECI will ensure that there is no irregularity and every voter is allowed to cast vote in a free and fair manner in the assembly polls.
 We know how to get it done," he said.
 The ECI on Friday met Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, Home Secretary HK Dwivedi, DGP Virendra and other senior officials, the CEC said.
 Arora said the full bench of the ECI asked the chief secretary and home secretary to look into the issues of fake information in the social media raised by political parties.
 According to the CEC, the chief secretary and the home secretary of the state said that they are following the EC's guidelines in letter and spirit.
 The ECI asked the senior officials and police officers of West Bengal to expedite the process of executing pending non-bailable warrants (NBWs), sources said.
 Arora said there will be 1,01,790 polling stations for the 2021 assembly elections in the state and every booth should be made accessible to all persons with disabilities.

NEW DELHI: Many women Army officers have approached the Supreme Court alleging that its order directing the Central government to grant Permanent Commission (PC) to women officers in the Army's non-combat support units on par with their male counterparts was not properly implemented.
 One such petition was filed by a woman officer, through her lawyer, Chitrangda Rastravara and Advocate on Record (AOR) Archana Pathak Dave, before the Supreme Court seeking its immediate direction to implement the February 2020 order.
 The petition copy, read and exclusively accessed by ANI, filed before the Apex Court by the woman Army officer, revealed that till date, as far as the procedural aspects of implementation are concerned, there are certain ambiguities, which have not been addressed by the Army.
 Rastravara, while talking to ANI, said that the Apex Court had clearly in its verdict in February 2020, had directed the Central government to give all benefits to all women officers, including PC, including promotion and all consequential benefits, irrespective of the number of years of service they might have put in.
 "Despite the ruling of the Top Court, the implementation of the judgment is done only for good optics, and to eliminate the women officers from the Army rather than including them in the institution as per the intent of the directions given by the Supreme Court," she told ANI.
 "This case is about women Army officers being denied their rightful due of PC, which in spite of a prolonged legal battle of more than a decade is still not a reality today, due to the absence of a clear-cut policy about the procedure adopted to assess women officers and application of arbitrary parameters by the army without any basis, she added.
 Rastravara alleged that women officers in the Army are still fighting gender stereotypes before the Supreme Court.
 She also sought the Apex Court's intervention to direct enforcement of its own order in letter and spirit, by the respondent, Army, after one year of the judgement was pronounced.
 "The unknown/unnotified and arbitrary benchmark of scoring above the lowest graded gentlemen officer of the parallel batch is one of the parameters that has never been applied in the usual case for gentlemen officers and thus is affecting the morale of these highly meritorious women officers," she said.
 "The Army, however, claimed that out of 615 women officers, 422 are eligible and found fit for PC in the Army.
 But in reality, only 277 out of 422 have been granted PC and the remaining number i.
e.
 145 are those officers who are either non-optees or whose result is withheld due to medical and administrative reasons.
 193 officers have been denied PC," she added.
 According to Rastravara's petition, the figure of 422 is a figure only for "good optics" and does not "truly portray the actual number".
 "Thus, finding those officers who are non-optees fit for PC and denying the same to optees smacks of gross arbitrariness," read the petition.
 These petitions are likely to come up for hearing before the Supreme Court on January 27.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said rapid development of Assam and northeast region are integral part of self-reliant India and highlighted that the region is widening the country's connection with the eastern Asian countries under the 'Act East' Policy.
 He reached Assam earlier in the day to distribute land pattas/allotment certificates to indigenous people in Sivasagar.
 Addressing a public meeting in Assam's Sivasagar, he said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has always kept the preservation of the Assamese culture in its top priority list and implemented policies for protection of the Assamese language and promotion of its literature.
 "The fast-paced development of Assam is very important to us.
 The way to 'Atmanirbhar Assam' is through 'Atmavishwaas' (self-confidence) among the people here.
 40 per cent of the state's population is taking benefit of 'Ayushmaan Bharat' scheme of the Central government," PM Modi said.
 "Rapid development of Assam and Northeast India is integral to AatmaNirbhar Bharat.
 The road to an AatmaNirbhar Assam is through the confidence of Assamese people.
 Assam has seen unprecedented developmental work in the last few years," he added.
 PM Modi further said: "In the last six years, Assam and Northeast are witnessing unprecedented development in terms of connectivity and other infrastructure.
 Today, Assam and Northeast are widening our connection with the Eastern Asian countries under the 'Act East' Policy.
 Assam is developing as a major part of AatmaNirbhar Bharat with better infrastructure.
" The Prime Minister said a large part of Assam has now returned to the path of peace and development with the historic Bodo Agreement.
 "The agreement was followed by the first elections to the Bodoland Territorial Council and representatives were elected.
 Now the Bodo Territorial Council will establish new paradigms of development and trust," he added.
 PM Modi said over Rs 40,000 crores have been invested over the years on oil and gas-related infrastructure in Assam.
 Gas connectivity of North East and East India is going to be strengthened by the Guwahati-Barauni gas pipeline, he added.
 He also lauded the Assam government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.
 "I am sure they will take the vaccination programme ahead with the same enthusiasm," he added.
 PM Modi also distributed land pattas/allotment certificates to indigenous people in Sivasagar, under the state government programme to one lakh beneficiaries.
 "Today, the government of Assam has solved a major concern of your life.
 More than 1 lakh native families will now get the right to own land," he said.
 The Prime Minister said special emphasis is being given to secure the rights of indigenous people related to land along with preserving their language and culture.
 "When we formed the government in Assam, there were 6 lakh indigenous families who did not have their land papers.
 During the previous government, it was not a matter of concern for them.
 But Sarbananda Sonowal-led government worked seriously to make this concern go away.
" "Special emphasis is being given on securing rights of indigenous people related to land along with preserving their language and culture.
 The new land policy unveiled in 2019 shows the commitment of this government.
 More than 2.
25 lakh native families have given land pattas.
 Now more than 1 lakh families will add to it," he said.
 PM Modi said nearly 1.
75 crore Jan Dhan accounts in Assam have been opened for the poor, which helped the government to provide assistance during Covid-19 pandemic.
 "Today, nearly 40 per cent population of Assam has benefitted from Ayushman Bharat.
 1.
5 lakh people have received free treatment already.
 35 lakh women have Ujjwala gas connections, with 4 lakh families in this belonging to SC/ST groups," he added.
 The Prime Minister said less than 50 per cent of households in Assam had access to electricity five years ago and today it has now gone up to nearly 100 per cent.
 In the last 1.
5 years, water connections have been provided to more than 2.
5 lakh households in Assam under the Jal Jeevan Mission, he informed.
 "The Centre-State double engine government is working to supply running water to all the households of the state," he said.
 The prime minister pointed out that the government is taking necessary steps to include Sivasagar as one of the five most iconic archaeological sites in India.
 PM Modi also remembered Netaji Subash Chandra Bose on his 125th birth anniversary today.
 "The entire country is celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose, today.
 The country has decided to celebrate this day as 'Prakram Diwas'.
 His life gives us inspiration even today," he added.

 We are questioning him, but nothing has so far been found that points to any kind of conspiracy, as is being alleged," the official said, adding that further investigations are underway.
 At the Singhu border press conference late on Friday night, the farmer leaders presented the man who claimed that his accomplices were asked to pose as policemen and baton-charge the crowd during the proposed tractor parade in the national capital on Republic Day.
 Have offered best deal possible: Government tells farmer unionsThe farmer leaders claimed that they caught the man from the protest site at the Singhu border.
 He was subsequently handed over to the Haryana police.
 Farmer leader Kulwant Singh Sandhu alleged that attempts are being made to disrupt the ongoing agitation against three farm laws.
 The man, who had his face covered with a scarf, claimed at the press conference that a plan was hatched to shoot four farmer leaders, who are known faces in the media, at the stage on Saturday.
 "On January 26, there was a plan to create disturbance during the tractor parade by opening fire on Delhi Police personnel, which would prompt them to retaliate against the protesting farmers in a strong manner," he said.
 Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several border points of Delhi since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.
 Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.
 However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

No one can say that Khalsa Aidâs work has been for a particular community or religion: Amarpreet Singh

From basic essentials like drinking water to setting up 800-bed shelters, humanitarian organisation Khalsa Aid India has been working at the farmers protest sites for over two months.
 Now under investigation by Indiaâs counter-terrorism agency NIA, Khalsa Aid director Amarpreet Singh tells TOI that he will let the organisationâs work speak for itself.
 Khalsa Aid has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize by Canadian politicians.
 Do you think that the organisationâs charity work has not been recognised in India where it is being investigated?It was a good feeling to be nominated for our humanitarian work.
 But we donât crave recognition.
 Trolls and investigation notices do not matter.
 At the same time we have received so much support from people.
 Beneficiaries know about our work and that is enough.
 Our supporters, which is mainly the Sikh community, have donated their time, money and resources, so we can give back to them in their hour of need.
 I just hope this (the investigation) does not affect the motivation of our volunteers who are taking time out of their work and lives to do some good work.
 It can be distracting for them.
 You have been accused of funnelling foreign funds in India for the Khalistani cause and have been summoned by the National Investigation Agency.
 Are you ready for a probe into the sources of your funding? There have always been detractors but we let our work speak for itself.
 We are open to any investigation.
 In fact three people from Khalsa Aid including me received notices and are cooperating with authorities.
 There is nothing to hide.
 A trustee has already met the NIA officials and answered their questions.
 I was summoned but later they postponed the meeting.
 When we worked with Rohingya Muslim refugees and the riot-affected in north-east Delhi we were asked why we were helping Muslims.
 Now when we are working with the Sikh community, we are being asked if we support Khalistanis.
 We have been working for 21 years for the cause of humanity in disaster zones across the country whether it is Kerala or Bihar.
 Internationally, Khalsa Aid International is working in conflict zones like Yemen, Iraq and doing humanitarian work in Malawi, Kenya and Zambia.
 No one can say that our work has been for a particular community or religion.
 What is the work your organisation is doing at the farmers protest sites? Has this been your most challenging project?Khalsa Aid started its work when the farmers started protesting against the farm laws in Punjab itself.
 We started langar (food) distribution twice a day and when the protest moved towards Delhi, we set up operations here.
 For the initial 10 days we were serving meals, milk and drinking water.
 We would have served 1 lakh meals during that time.
 The farmers had bought provisions and when they realised that they would not be allowed to move any further, they started cooking their own food.
 We shifted to distributing daily essentials about 25 items like hygiene products, soaps, blankets and mattresses.
 We would have distributed 10 trucks of blankets, about 15-20 trucks of mattresses and some raincoats when the weather turned bad.
 We have also given out 7000 first-aid kits and fire extinguishers after our internal assessment team found that there were some mishaps when the farmers were cooking on cylinders.
 We have also set up a 800-bed shelter at Tikri border and a 550 bed arrangement at Singhu.
 This has been the most challenging and largest project we have done in India till now.
 We have 150-180 volunteers on the field for this.
 What was the idea behind Kisan Mall that you recently set up?We have two Kisan Malls, one each at Singhu and Tikri Border where 950-1000 people visit daily.
 People have to show their identity card and fill a form and list the products they need.
 The protestors should not feel like they are receiving charity.
 They are from well-off backgrounds and they have been forced to live in a tractor-trolley on the street.
 These are our friends and neighbours.
 We felt that the idea of choosing to take what they need would be more respectful and it has been successful.

PUNE: The tiny clinking vials supervised by silent PPE-wearing technicians belie the excitement inside the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India, a major player in the fight against coronavirus.
 The firm, founded in 1966 in the western city of Pune, is producing millions of doses of the Covishield vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, for India and much of the developing world.
 Unlike the rival Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Covishield can be stored and transported using standard refrigeration.

 (Reuters)It is also significantly cheaper than the vaccines developed by Pfizer or the US firm Moderna, making it better suited for countries with poorer populations and rusty infrastructure.
 Even before the pandemic, the Indian firm was a world leader in vaccines, producing 1.
5 billion doses a year and inoculating two out of three children in 170 countries against diseases such as polio, mumps, meningitis and measles.
 Its journey kicked off on a stud farm, where the firm's owners, the Poonawalla family, began breeding horses in 1946, before a conversation with a vet sparked the realisation that anti-toxin serum extracted from the animals could be used to make vaccines.
 Inside visuals of the production and processing unit of Serum Institute of India (ANI)The Serum Institute soon became a market leader thanks to its cheap and effective drugs, which were eagerly sought after by price-conscious governments and consumers, prompting the company to expand at a dizzying rate.
 Adar Poonawalla, its 40-year-old CEO, has spent nearly a billion dollars in recent years enlarging and improving the sprawling Pune campus.
 As a result, when the coronavirus pandemic began to sweep across the world, the company, which recorded annual revenues of over $800 million in 2019-20 and is debt-free, was in pole position to reap the rewards.
 The palm-fringed Pune campus, whose grounds boast horse-shaped topiaries in a playful nod to the firm's origins, is home to several buildings where vaccines are manufactured and scrutinised for quality before being deposited into sterilised vials and stored for delivery.

 from being able to make 1.
5 billion shots in a year right now, to over 2.
5 billion doses by the end of 2021.
 In a telephonic interview with the Associated Press, Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla, 39, said that he anticipates more viruses jumping from animal to human host.
 He said that the added capacity would be very useful in coming decades.

 (AP)From Brazil to South Africa, there is no shortage of customers, with governments clamouring to buy Covishield.
 With Poonawalla vowing to reserve 50 percent of Covishield stocks for the Indian market, New Delhi, which intends to immunise 300 million people by July, is engaging in a bout of vaccine diplomacy, planning to supply 20 million doses to its South Asian neighbours.
 The Serum Institute also plans to supply 200 million doses to Covax, a World Health Organization-backed effort to procure and distribute inoculations to poor countries.

 (Reuters)If all this sounds overwhelming, the firm's bosses are not worried.
 " We are used to these kinds of pressures because even in the past there were situations when we were required to step up the production to meet individual countries' requirements," Suresh Jadhav, Serum Institute's executive director, told AFP.
 Even a deadly fire at an under-construction building this week failed to dent confidence, with Poonawalla promptly tweeting that "there would be no loss of #COVISHIELD production due to multiple production buildings that I had kept in reserve to deal with such contingencies".

 (AP)The pandemic has transformed Poonawalla's public profile, from a jet-setting billionaire known for his expensive taste in cars and fine art to a pharma-tycoon applauded for his willingness to take risks and his commitment to affordable vaccines.
 Unsurprisingly, the father-of-two has not held back from taking so-called anti-vaxxers to task, including berating US rapper Kanye West for spreading conspiracy theories.
 "Though we enjoy your music very much @KanyeWest, your views on #vaccines come across as irresponsible and borderline dangerous, considering the influence you have today and may have in the future; vaccines save lives," Poonawalla tweeted in July.
