TEXT:
COLOMBO: Sri Lanka on Friday launched its national coronavirus immunisation campaign by administering the first shots to frontline health workers, soldiers and security personnel, a day after India gifted 500,000 doses of Covishield vaccine to the island nation.
 Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday thanked India for its generosity after he received 500,000 doses of Covishield vaccine donated by the country under the 'Neighbourhood First' policy.
 The consignment was packed in 42 boxes.
 Rajapaksa was joined at the airport by the Indian envoy in Colombo Gopal Baglay.
 Frontline health workers, the Army and Police are on the priority list to receive the coronavirus vaccine, the Colombo Gazette reported.
 The coronavirus vaccination programme will begin at six hospitals in and around Colombo.
 The first jabs were given to three soldiers at the Army Hospital in Colombo, the report said.
 Senior Consultant Physician at the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) in Angoda Dr.
 Ananda Wijewickrama became the first healthcare official to receive the vaccine, it said.
 The Health Ministry said earlier that the vaccination programme will be carried out on the staff at six hospitals on Friday, the report added.
 Health Services deputy director general Dr.
 Hemantha Herath said that selected staff at the Colombo National Hospital, Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Colombo North Teaching Hospital, Homagama Base Hospital, Colombo East Base Hospital and the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) in Angoda will be vaccinated, the report added.
 He said that around 25 per cent of the staff at these hospitals will be vaccinated at the start.
 A total of 250,000 people, mostly health frontline workers, members of the security forces and police and the vulnerable aged, will get the vaccine on a priority basis.
 Sri Lanka has recorded more than 61,000 coronavirus cases so far with 297 deaths.
 India is one of the world's biggest drug-makers and an increasing number of countries have already approached it for procuring the coronavirus vaccines.
 The Oxford-Astrazeneca's Covishield vaccine is manufactured by Serum Institute of India.
 This has been approved for emergency use by the Sri Lankan government.
 The gift from India is in line with India's continued support to Sri Lanka in fighting the COVID pandemic.
 Four consignments of medical supplies weighing around 25 tonnes were donated by India, which also organised online experience-sharing programmes for Sri Lankan medical professionals.
 The two nations have also put up a joint front in the COVID-19 battle with India and Sri Lanka being the largest contributors to the COVID-19 Emergency Fund for SAARC.
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had complimented Sri Lanka's leadership on containing the pandemic.

No decision yet on future force posture in Afghanistan: Pentagon

TEXT:
WASHINGTON: No decision has been made about the future presence of the US troops in Afghanistan, the Pentagon has said, asserting that the Biden administration is committed to responsibly end the war in the strife-torn country with the diplomatic process.
 The previous Trump administration had signed the peace deal with Taliban in February last in Doha.
 The accord drew up plans for withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the insurgent group.
 As part of the deal, the US committed to withdraw its 12,000 troops from Afghanistan within 14 months.
 There are currently only 2,500 American troops left in the war-torn country.
 'We obviously are still committed to ending this war, but we want to do it in a responsible way, and I don't think it's helpful to be drawn now into specific hypothetical questions about the troop numbers on a specific calendar basis,' John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said on Thursday.
 "We are still committed to ending this war, and we obviously, the president has made it clear he wants to bring American troops home from Afghanistan, but we are going to do it in lockstep with the diplomatic process to try to find a negotiated settlement,' he said.
 'If any decision of force levels in Afghanistan is going to be driven by our security requirements there, our security commitments there and driven by conditions, and I think we have been very clear about that.
 They will be conditions-based.
 We obviously want to see a responsible end to this war.
 We obviously want to see successful negotiated settlements to end it,' he said.
 Responding to a question, Kirby said the Taliban are not meeting their commitments to reduce violence and to renounce their ties to al-Qaida, and they're not meeting their commitments.
 'As long as they are not meeting their commitments, it's going to be difficult for anybody at that negotiating table to meet their commitments.
 In fact, it wouldn't be the wise course,' he said.
 The United States, Kirby said, is still involved in trying to get a negotiated settlement.
 'The Taliban have not met their commitments.
 As you know, there is a looming deadline of early May that is before everybody in terms of wanting to have a solution here,' he said.
 'But without them meeting their commitments to renounce the terrorism and to stop the violent attacks on the Afghan national security forces and by dint of that the Afghan people, it's very hard to see a specific way forward for the negotiated settlement.
 But we're still committed to that.
 There's no question about that,' he said.
 Defence secretary Lloyd Austin has been clear in testimony that the US needs to find a reasonable rational end to this war, and that it's got to be done through a negotiated settlement.
 That includes the Afghan government having to be involved in this.
 And thus far, the Taliban has been, to put it politely, reticent to meet their requirements, Kirby said.
 Both General Miller, the commander in Afghanistan, and of course the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley has made it clear that they believe that that is a sufficient number to accomplish the mission, which is largely a counterterrorism mission right now, he said, adding that there are many NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) partners in Afghanistan as well.
 'There hasn't been any decisions made now about what that force presence is going to look like going forward.
 I would say this to leaders of the Taliban, that it is going to be--they make it that much more difficult for final decisions to be made about force presence by their reticence to commit to reasonable, sustainable, and credible negotiations at the table,' Kirby said.
 The Taliban is committed to prevent other groups, including Al Qaeda, from using Afghan soil to recruit, train or fund raise toward activities that threaten the US or its allies.
 Although the Taliban stopped attacks on international forces as part of the historic deal, it continued to fight the Afghan government.
 As a condition of starting talks with the Afghan government, the Taliban demanded that thousands of their members be released in a prisoner swap.
 Direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban began in Doha in September last year, but a breakthrough is yet to be reached.
 Levels of violence in Afghanistan remain high with journalists, activists, politicians and women judges among those killed in targeted assassinations.

WASHINGTON: The Biden administration will name Robert Malley as its special envoy for Iran, a senior state department official said on Thursday.
 He would thus be given one of the most daunting and politically divisive foreign policy challenges facing the US government.
 Malley was a key member of former President Barack Obama's team that negotiated the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and world powers, an agreement that former president Donald Trump abandoned in 2018 despite strong opposition from Washington's European allies.
 "Secretary Blinken is building a dedicated team, drawing from clear-eyed experts with a diversity of views.
 Leading that team as our special envoy for Iran will be Rob Malley, who brings to the position a track record of success negotiating constraints on Iran's nuclear program," the state department official said.
 "The secretary is confident he and his team will be able to do that once again," the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, referring to Biden's secretary of state Antony Blinken.
 The state department declined comment.
 Malley did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 When Malley's name first surfaced in news reports as a leading candidate for the post, he drew criticism from some Republican lawmakers and pro-Israel groups that expressed concern that he would be soft on Iran and tough on Israel.
 But a number of foreign policy veterans rushed to his defence, praising him as a respected, even-handed diplomat.
 The post would make Malley the point person in Biden's efforts to deal with Iran after years of worsening relations under Trump, who, after pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, reimposed crippling economic sanctions.
 The Diplomatic news website was first to report on Malley's expected appointment.
 He held numerous senior positions in the Democratic administrations of Obama and former President Bill Clinton with a focus on Middle East and Gulf policymaking and informally advised Biden's team during the 2020 campaign.
 Most recently, he was the president of the International Crisis Group, a non-profit organization focused on global conflict.
 Crafting Iran policyMalley's expected appointment comes as Biden and his foreign policy aides move to craft their approach to Iran.
 Malley is expected to report directly to Blinken, a source familiar with the matter said.
 Biden's top diplomat on Wednesday stuck to the new administration's stance that Tehran must resume complying with the Iran nuclear deal before Washington would do so.
 Making his first public comments on Iran as secretary of state, Blinken reiterated Biden's policy "that if Iran comes back into full compliance with its obligations under the JCPOA, the United States would do the same thing.
" But Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Twitter on Thursday that the United States should make the first move by returning to the nuclear pact.
 The nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was struck by Iran and six major powers and committed Iran to restricting its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief from the United States and others.
 Israel and Gulf Arab states strongly opposed the deal as not stringent enough on Tehran.
 Malley, the son of an Egyptian journalist and Iran expert, was an informal adviser to Obama's 2008 campaign but resigned after it emerged he had met with representatives of the Palestinian militant group Hamas while working for the International Crisis Group.
 Malley was later brought into the Obama administration, in which Biden served as Vice President, as a top Middle East adviser.

TEXT:
WASHINGTON: Donald Trump met with US House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in Florida Thursday amid a tug of war over the Republican Party's future, with congressional leadership appearing eager to present a united front with the former president.
 Winning back the House of Representatives from Democrats in 2022 was the primary topic of the meeting at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, according to a readout provided by Save America, a political action committee linked to Trump.
 "President Trump's popularity has never been stronger than it is today, and his endorsement means more than perhaps any endorsement at any time," it said.
 McCarthy, an ally who encouraged Trump's baseless election fraud claims, distanced himself from the outgoing president after Trump was accused of inspiring his supporters to storm the US Capitol earlier this month.
 He declared that Joe Biden was the winner of the November election and that Trump "bears responsibility for (the January 6) attack on Congress by mob rioters.
" But on Thursday McCarthy appeared back in Trump's graces, as the men grinned broadly in a handout photograph taken in an ornate room reminiscent of a European palace.
 "Today, President Trump committed to helping elect Republicans in the House and Senate in 2022," McCarthy said in a statement that also attacked Democrats for "impeaching a president who is now a private citizen.
" "A united conservative movement will strengthen the bonds of our citizens and uphold the freedoms our country was founded on," McCarthy added.
 House Democrat Katherine Clark expressed shock that McCarthy was re-aligning with Trump after the "seditious" Capitol assault.
 Despite "active threats of violence," she said, "Kevin McCarthy's response is a photo op with the treasonous instigator.
" With Trump impeached for an unprecedented second time, and the Senate girding for his trial, it was unclear how much political clout Trump would retain beyond his presidency.
 But recently several Republicans, following polling showing strong party support for Trump, have signaled they will remain in the brash billionaire's orbit -- or at least not publicly break with him.
 Pro-Trump Republicans will hold huge sway in the coming years.
 They are a large enough contingent to influence the Republican primaries.
 But should Trump be cast out and they abandon ship, the party would be severely weakened in its attempts to challenge Democrats for congressional control.
 "You have the Trump wing of the party, wanting to purge those who have stood up to the president's lies, (and) you have the establishment wing of the party wanting to purge the party of Trump," Republican former congressman Carlos Curbelo told MSNBC.
 "Right now, it's clear that the Trump wing is dominant.

BEIJING: A World Health Organization-led team of experts investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic began meeting with Chinese scientists on Friday, and the WHO said the group plans to visit labs, markets and hospitals in Wuhan.
 On Thursday, the team completed two weeks of quarantine following its arrival in China, moving to a lakeside hotel in the central Chinese city where the deadly virus emerged in late 2019.
 "First face to face meeting with our colleagues.
 Correction: facemask to facemask given the medical restrictions.
 Discussing our visiting program," Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, tweeted on Friday.
 "China teamleader prof Wannian joking about some technical glitches.
 Nice to see our colleagues after lengthy zoom meetings," she said.
 The group is expected to spend two more weeks in China, and will visit the seafood market at the centre of the early outbreak.
 It will also visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
 One hypothesis, rejected by China, is that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the government lab.
 The WHO has sought to manage expectations.
 "There are no guarantees of answers," its emergency chief, Mike Ryan, said earlier this month.
 The mission has been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between China and the United States, which has accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.
 "It is important to remember that the success of this mission and origin-tracing is 100% depending on access to the relevant sources," Thea Fischer, a Danish member of the team, told Reuters on Thursday.
 "No matter how competent we are, how hard we work and how many stones we try to turn, this can only be possible with the support from China," she said.
 The origin of Covid-19 has been highly politicised.
 The investigating team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which former US President Donald Trump accused of being "China-centric".
 China has pushed the idea that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, with state media citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers saying it had been circulating in Europe in 2019.
 China's foreign ministry has also hinted that the sudden closure of a US army laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland in July 2019 was linked to the pandemic.
 "At the early stage in China, it was a burden particularly for Wuhan people when everyone was calling it a Wuhan virus, which was humiliating," said Yang You, a 30-year-old Wuhan resident.
 "If it could be traced to the source clearly, in my opinion, it could clear either China's or Wuhan's name.

US âoutraged' over Pakistan SC acquitting Daniel Pearl's killers: White House

TEXT:
WASHINGTON: The White House has expressed 'outrage' over Pakistan Supreme Court's decision acquitting those involved in the sensational kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl in 2002 and said that the judgement is an "affront" to terrorism victims everywhere.
 Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story in 2002 on the links between the country's powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.
 Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed appeals against the acquittal of British-born al-Qaeda terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh in the kidnapping and murder case of Pearl and ordered his release, a judgement denounced by the American journalist's family as "a complete travesty of justice.
" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, during her daily news conference on Thursday, said: 'The United States is outraged by the Pakistani Supreme Court's decision to affirm the acquittals of those responsible for Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl's kidnapping and brutal murder which shocked the world's conscience in 2002'.
 'This decision to exonerate and release Sheikh and the other suspects is an affront to terrorism victims everywhere, including in Pakistan.
 We recognise past Pakistani actions to try to hold Mr Pearl's murderers accountable, and we do note that as of right now, Omar Sheikh remains in detention in Pakistan under national security authorities.
 'But we call on the Pakistani government to expeditiously review its legal options including allowing the United States to prosecute for the brutal murder of an American citizen and journalist,' Psaki said in response to a question on the latest development in Pakistan.
 Sheikh and his three aides - Fahad Naseem, Sheikh Adil and Salman Saqib - were convicted and sentenced in the abduction and murder case of Pearl in Karachi in 2002.
 The United States, she said, is committed to securing justice for Pearl's family and holding terrorists anywhere accountable for their heinous crimes.
 Reacting to the acquittal, US Secretary of State Tony Blinken, in a strongly worded statement, urged Pakistan to explore all legal options to ensure that the killers of Pearl are brought to justice.
 'The United States is deeply concerned by the Pakistani Supreme Court's decision to acquit those involved in Daniel Pearl's kidnapping and murder and any proposed action to release them,' he said.
 Blinken said: 'Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh was indicted in the United States in 2002 for hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking, resulting in the murder of Pearl, the South Asia Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal, as well as the 1994 kidnapping of another United States citizen in India'.
 The court's decision is an affront to terrorism victims everywhere, including in Pakistan, he said.
 'We expect the Pakistani government to expeditiously review its legal options to ensure justice is served.
 We take note of the Attorney General's statement that he intends to seek review and recall of the decision.
 We are also prepared to prosecute Sheikh in the United States for his horrific crimes against an American citizen,' Blinken said.
 The United States is committed to securing justice for Pearl's family and holding terrorists accountable, he said.
 Pearl's murder took place three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.
 He was serving a prison term in India for kidnappings of Western tourists in the country.
 The beheading of the American journalist in 2002 had grabbed international headlines.
 Pakistan Supreme Court ordered that three others, who had been sentenced to life in prison for their part in Pearl's kidnapping and death, also be freed.
 Ruth and Judea Pearl - the parents of Pearl - criticised the judgment that would endanger the lives of journalists everywhere, said Faisal Siddiqi, the Pearl family lawyer.
 In April 2020, a two-judge Sindh High Court bench commuted the death sentence of 46-year-old Sheikh to seven years imprisonment.
 The court also acquitted his three aides who were serving life terms in the case - almost two decades after they were found guilty and jailed.
 The Sindh government and family of Pearl filed petitions in the apex court, challenging the high court verdict.
 The US has been mounting pressure on Pakistan, demanding justice for Pearl.
 Last month, the US said it is ready to take custody of Sheikh, asserting that Washington will not allow him to evade justice.
 Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson said the US is deeply concerned by the Pakistani Supreme Court's ruling affirming the acquittal of individuals convicted by a Pakistani trial court.
 'The release of those involved would be an affront to Daniel Pearl's family, to other terrorism victims around the world, and to the cause of justice,' Wilkinson said.
 In a tweet, Congressman Brad Sherman said: 'The killers of Daniel Pearl go free.
 And Dr.
 Afridi, who helped the US get Osama Bin Laden, rots in jail.
' 'We are deeply disappointed that Pakistan's Supreme Court has acquitted and ordered the release of Ahmad Saeed Omar Sheikh, despite overwhelming evidence of Sheikh's involvement in the kidnapping of Daniel Pearl, which led directly to his murder,' said Steven Butler, Committee to Protect Journalist's Asia program coordinator.

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Thursday ordered government health insurance markets to reopen for a special sign-up window, offering uninsured Americans a haven as the spread of Covid-19 remains dangerously high and vaccines aren't yet widely available.
 Biden signed an executive order directing the HealthCare.
gov insurance markets to take new applications for subsidized benefits, something Donald Trump's administration had refused to do.
 He also instructed his administration to consider reversing other Trump health care policies, including curbs on abortion counseling and the imposition of work requirements for low-income people getting Medicaid.
 "There's nothing new that we're doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became president,'' Biden said as he signed the directives in the Oval Office.
 He declared he was reversing ``my predecessor's attack on women's health.
" The actions were only the first steps by Biden, who has promised to build out former President Barack Obama's health care law to achieve a goal of coverage for all.
 While Biden rejects the idea of a government-run system that Sen.
 Bernie Sanders has pushed for in his ``Medicare for All'' proposal, his more centrist approach will require congressional buy-in.
 But opposition to "Obamacare"runs deep among Republicans.
 The most concrete short-term impact of Biden's orders will come from reopening HealthCare.
gov insurance markets as coverage has shrunk in the economic turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.
 That's an executive action and no legislation is required.
 The new ``special enrollment period'' will begin Feb.
 15 and run through May 15, the White House said.
 It will be coupled with a promotional campaign and a call for states that run their own insurance markets to match the federal sign-up opportunity.
 The Biden administration has ample resources for marketing, said Karen Pollitz, a health insurance expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.
 The foundation estimates that the Trump administration left unspent about $1.
2 billion in user fees collected from insurers to help pay for running the marketplaces.
 ``The reason it wasn't spent is the Trump administration spent its time in office cutting services that support consumer enrollment,'' Pollitz said.
 ``All the while the user fee revenue was coming in, (but) they were not allowed to spend it on anything other than marketplace operations.
'' Created under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, the marketplaces offer taxpayer-subsidized coverage regardless of a person's medical history or preexisting conditions, including Covid-19.
 Biden also ordered the immediate reversal of a federal policy that bars taxpayer funding for international health care nonprofits that promote or provide abortions.
 Known as the Mexico City Policy, it can be switched on or off depending on whether Democrats or Republicans control the White House.
 Abortion rights supporters call it the ``global gag rule.
'' The new president's signing of a growing stack of executive orders is bringing increasing criticism from Republicans and also from some of his allies, especially after Democrats lambasted Trump when he acted on his own.
 Biden's team says he's looking to Congress for major legislation but feels that certain actions are crucial in the meantime.
 Some directives he issued Thursday could take months to carry out.
 He instructed the Department of Health and Human Services to consider rescinding Trump regulations that bar federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions.
 HHS will also reexamine a Trump administration policy that allows states to impose work requirements as a condition for low-income people to get Medicaid health insurance.
 Work requirements have been blocked by federal courts, which found that they led to thousands of people losing coverage and violated Medicaid's legal charge to provide medical services.
 The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the issue.
 And Biden directed HHS to review Trump policies that could undermine protections for people with health problems, such as a rule that facilitated the sale of short-term health insurance plans that don't have to cover preexisting medical conditions.
 Such changes cannot happen overnight.
 Rescinding a federal regulation requires a new regulation, which has to follow an established legal process that involves considering different sides of an issue.
 Former Trump health policy adviser Brian Blase said the Biden administration has to take care it doesn't throw out some policies intended to help solidly middle-class people who don't qualify for financial assistance under Obama's law.
 `` Obamacare plans are generally only attractive to people who receive large subsidies to buy them,'' said Blase.
 He cited a Trump policy that allows employers to provide tax-free money for workers to buy individual plans.
 The abortion-related actions brought Biden immediate praise from women's rights groups, as well as condemnation from social and religious conservatives.
 Under President Trump, abortion opponents had free rein to try to rewrite federal policy, but now the political pendulum has swung back.
 Trump's abortion counseling restrictions led Planned Parenthood affiliates to leave the federal family planning program.
 Biden campaigned on repealing longstanding federal prohibitions against taxpayer funding for most abortions, but that was not part of Thursday's orders.
 A change of that magnitude to a group of laws known as the Hyde Amendment would require congressional approval.
 Biden's nominee for health secretary, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, has not yet been confirmed by the Senate, but the White House said that will not stop health agencies from immediately going to work on the president's directives.
 The idea of reopening Obamacare's health insurance markets in the pandemic has had broad support from consumer, medical, and business organizations.
 The main insurer trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans, applauded Biden's move.
 As the number of uninsured Americans grew because of job losses in the pandemic, the Trump administration resisted calls to reopen HealthCare.
gov.
 Failure to repeal and replace Obamacare was one of the former president's most bitter disappointments.
 His administration continued trying to find ways to limit the program or unravel it entirely.
 A Supreme Court decision on Trump's final legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act is expected this year.
 Experts agree that number of uninsured people has risen because of layoffs in the coronavirus economy, but authoritative estimates await government studies due later this year.
 While some estimates cite 5 million to 10 million newly uninsured people, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says its analysis suggests a smaller number.
 Nonetheless, the CBO projects that nearly 32 million Americans are uninsured and of those, about 2 in 3 are eligible for some kind of subsidized coverage.
 The Obama-era health care law covers more than 23 million people through a mix of subsidized private insurance sold in all states, and expanded Medicaid adopted by 38 states.

 Malley was later brought into the Obama administration, in which Biden served as Vice President, as a top Middle East adviser.

TEXT:
WASHINGTON: Donald Trump met with US House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in Florida Thursday amid a tug of war over the Republican Party's future, with congressional leadership appearing eager to present a united front with the former president.
 Winning back the House of Representatives from Democrats in 2022 was the primary topic of the meeting at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, according to a readout provided by Save America, a political action committee linked to Trump.
 "President Trump's popularity has never been stronger than it is today, and his endorsement means more than perhaps any endorsement at any time," it said.
 McCarthy, an ally who encouraged Trump's baseless election fraud claims, distanced himself from the outgoing president after Trump was accused of inspiring his supporters to storm the US Capitol earlier this month.
 He declared that Joe Biden was the winner of the November election and that Trump "bears responsibility for (the January 6) attack on Congress by mob rioters.
" But on Thursday McCarthy appeared back in Trump's graces, as the men grinned broadly in a handout photograph taken in an ornate room reminiscent of a European palace.
 "Today, President Trump committed to helping elect Republicans in the House and Senate in 2022," McCarthy said in a statement that also attacked Democrats for "impeaching a president who is now a private citizen.
" "A united conservative movement will strengthen the bonds of our citizens and uphold the freedoms our country was founded on," McCarthy added.
 House Democrat Katherine Clark expressed shock that McCarthy was re-aligning with Trump after the "seditious" Capitol assault.
 Despite "active threats of violence," she said, "Kevin McCarthy's response is a photo op with the treasonous instigator.
" With Trump impeached for an unprecedented second time, and the Senate girding for his trial, it was unclear how much political clout Trump would retain beyond his presidency.
 But recently several Republicans, following polling showing strong party support for Trump, have signaled they will remain in the brash billionaire's orbit -- or at least not publicly break with him.
 Pro-Trump Republicans will hold huge sway in the coming years.
 They are a large enough contingent to influence the Republican primaries.
 But should Trump be cast out and they abandon ship, the party would be severely weakened in its attempts to challenge Democrats for congressional control.
 "You have the Trump wing of the party, wanting to purge those who have stood up to the president's lies, (and) you have the establishment wing of the party wanting to purge the party of Trump," Republican former congressman Carlos Curbelo told MSNBC.
 "Right now, it's clear that the Trump wing is dominant.

US âoutraged' over Pakistan SC acquitting Daniel Pearl's killers: White House

TEXT:
WASHINGTON: The White House has expressed 'outrage' over Pakistan Supreme Court's decision acquitting those involved in the sensational kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl in 2002 and said that the judgement is an "affront" to terrorism victims everywhere.
 Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story in 2002 on the links between the country's powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.
 Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed appeals against the acquittal of British-born al-Qaeda terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh in the kidnapping and murder case of Pearl and ordered his release, a judgement denounced by the American journalist's family as "a complete travesty of justice.
" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, during her daily news conference on Thursday, said: 'The United States is outraged by the Pakistani Supreme Court's decision to affirm the acquittals of those responsible for Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl's kidnapping and brutal murder which shocked the world's conscience in 2002'.
 'This decision to exonerate and release Sheikh and the other suspects is an affront to terrorism victims everywhere, including in Pakistan.
 We recognise past Pakistani actions to try to hold Mr Pearl's murderers accountable, and we do note that as of right now, Omar Sheikh remains in detention in Pakistan under national security authorities.
 'But we call on the Pakistani government to expeditiously review its legal options including allowing the United States to prosecute for the brutal murder of an American citizen and journalist,' Psaki said in response to a question on the latest development in Pakistan.
 Sheikh and his three aides - Fahad Naseem, Sheikh Adil and Salman Saqib - were convicted and sentenced in the abduction and murder case of Pearl in Karachi in 2002.
 The United States, she said, is committed to securing justice for Pearl's family and holding terrorists anywhere accountable for their heinous crimes.
 Reacting to the acquittal, US Secretary of State Tony Blinken, in a strongly worded statement, urged Pakistan to explore all legal options to ensure that the killers of Pearl are brought to justice.
 'The United States is deeply concerned by the Pakistani Supreme Court's decision to acquit those involved in Daniel Pearl's kidnapping and murder and any proposed action to release them,' he said.
 Blinken said: 'Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh was indicted in the United States in 2002 for hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking, resulting in the murder of Pearl, the South Asia Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal, as well as the 1994 kidnapping of another United States citizen in India'.
 The court's decision is an affront to terrorism victims everywhere, including in Pakistan, he said.
 'We expect the Pakistani government to expeditiously review its legal options to ensure justice is served.
 We take note of the Attorney General's statement that he intends to seek review and recall of the decision.
 We are also prepared to prosecute Sheikh in the United States for his horrific crimes against an American citizen,' Blinken said.
 The United States is committed to securing justice for Pearl's family and holding terrorists accountable, he said.
 Pearl's murder took place three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.
 He was serving a prison term in India for kidnappings of Western tourists in the country.
 The beheading of the American journalist in 2002 had grabbed international headlines.
 Pakistan Supreme Court ordered that three others, who had been sentenced to life in prison for their part in Pearl's kidnapping and death, also be freed.
 Ruth and Judea Pearl - the parents of Pearl - criticised the judgment that would endanger the lives of journalists everywhere, said Faisal Siddiqi, the Pearl family lawyer.
 In April 2020, a two-judge Sindh High Court bench commuted the death sentence of 46-year-old Sheikh to seven years imprisonment.
 The court also acquitted his three aides who were serving life terms in the case - almost two decades after they were found guilty and jailed.
 The Sindh government and family of Pearl filed petitions in the apex court, challenging the high court verdict.
 The US has been mounting pressure on Pakistan, demanding justice for Pearl.
 Last month, the US said it is ready to take custody of Sheikh, asserting that Washington will not allow him to evade justice.
 Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson said the US is deeply concerned by the Pakistani Supreme Court's ruling affirming the acquittal of individuals convicted by a Pakistani trial court.
 'The release of those involved would be an affront to Daniel Pearl's family, to other terrorism victims around the world, and to the cause of justice,' Wilkinson said.
 In a tweet, Congressman Brad Sherman said: 'The killers of Daniel Pearl go free.
 And Dr.
 Afridi, who helped the US get Osama Bin Laden, rots in jail.
' 'We are deeply disappointed that Pakistan's Supreme Court has acquitted and ordered the release of Ahmad Saeed Omar Sheikh, despite overwhelming evidence of Sheikh's involvement in the kidnapping of Daniel Pearl, which led directly to his murder,' said Steven Butler, Committee to Protect Journalist's Asia program coordinator.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the release of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the principal accused in the 2002 beheading of American journalist Daniel Pearl, dismissing the appeal of the government of Sindh province against a high court order for his immediate release.
 Pearl's family, in a statement released by their lawyer, said, 'Today's decision is a complete travesty of justice and the release of these killers puts in danger journalists everywhere and the people of Pakistan.
' The short order was issued by a three-judge SC bench headed by Justice Mushir Alam.
 One member of the bench opposed the decision.
 Sheikh's lawyer, Mahmud Sheikh said that according to the SC, there wasn't sufficient evidence to prove that Sheikh had committed the offence.
 Provincial attorney Salman Talibuddin said that the court also ordered that three others, who had been sentenced to life in prison for their part in Pearl's kidnapping and death, be freed.
 Faisal Siddiqi, the Pearl family lawyer, said the only legal avenue following the court's decision upholding Sheikh's acquittal would be to ask for a review.
 He, however, said the review would be conducted by the same court that upheld the appeal.
 'In practical terms, there are no further legal avenues to pursue the case in Pakistan.
' In April last year, the Sindh HC had overturned the death sentence of Sheikh, who had been convicted of the 2002 kidnapping and killing of the American journalist by an anti-terrorism court, into seven years' imprisonment and acquitted the three others.
 Apart from Sheikh, the others accused in the case were Fahad Naseem, Syed Suleman Saqib and Sheikh Muhammad Adil.
 Sheikh, who had already spent 18 years in prison on death row after his death sentence by an anti-terrorism court, was expected to be released after the high court verdict since his seven-year sentence was to be counted as time already served.
 The accused, however, were not released as the Sindh government kept them behind bars under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) law.
 The government can detain any suspect under the MPO for 90 days.
 On July 1, a fresh notification was issued by the provincial government to extend their detention by three months and later their confinement was extended for yet another 90 days.
 In December last year, the high court accepted a petition by the men against their continued detention and ordered their immediate release, declaring all notifications of the Sindh government related to their detention 'null and void'.
 Following the HC order, the Sindh government had filed an appeal with the SC against Sheikh's release.
 The Sindh government and Pearl's parents had also filed appeals against Sheikh's acquittal, a decision on which has not yet been announced by the top court.
 Daniel Pearl, 38, was the South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal when he was kidnapped in Karachi in January 2002.
 Pearl's wife, Marianne Pearl, a US national who was living in Karachi, wrote a letter to police on February 2, 2002, stating that her husband had disappeared on January 23, 2002.
 Later, a graphic video showing Pearl's decapitation was delivered to the US consulate in Karachi nearly a month after his abduction.

ISLAMABAD: The cockpit crew of a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) aircraft confirmed to have spotted an extraordinary object hovering in the sky in the airspace between Multan and Sahiwal on January 23.
 A short video clip shot by the crew from a window of the PIA's Lahore-bound flight, PK304, showed a strange-looking phenomenon in the skies, which immediately went viral on social media.
 A bright white circular object can be seen in the video as the cabin crew speculated about it, with one crew member saying it could not be a weather balloon.
 Captain Faisal Qureshi, the pilot, said the object was surrounded by a metal ring and it released brilliant light from its centre.
 The object, as seen in the video, has very little or no movement at all.
 Local TV stations reported that the unidentified flying object (UFO) spotted at 4.
30pm was 'extremely bright' despite the presence of sunlight.
 PIA spokesperson Abdullah Khan said the object was spotted by the pilot.
 'It was necessary to inform the public and the media about the phenomenon,' he said in a video message, but refused to comment on the nature of the mysterious object.
 It is not the first sighting of an UFO in Pakistan.
 A similar incident was also reported by PIA pilots in Karachi in January 2019.
 According to Scott C Wang, a blogger who posts about UFO sightings, the recorded video of the unidentified object is the most focused and accurate image of a 'foo fighter' in UFO's research history.
 'Aliens follow human movements and activities by following their planes,' claimed Scott.

TEXT:
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's defence ministry has opposed a request seeking removal of the name of former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen (retired) Asad Durrani from the Exit Control List (ECL), or no-fly list, stating that he had been 'interacting with hostile elements', including Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), since 2008 and was likely to be involved in future activities against the interest of the country.
 Durrani had put himself in a difficult situation after co-authoring a book ' The Spy Chronicles: RAW, ISI and the Illusion of Peace ' with ex-RAW chief Amarjit Singh Dulat in 2018.
 Following the book's publication, the interior ministry had placed Durrani's name on ECL after being asked by the Military Intelligence (MI) to prevent him from leaving Pakistan.
 It had prompted Durrani to challenge the move in the Islamabad high court in 2019.
 The federation of Pakistan, defence and interior ministers were made respondents in the case.
 In a written reply submitted in the HC on Wednesday in response to Durrani's petition, the defence ministry said the former ISI chief's name was placed on the no-fly list for 'his involvement in anti-state activities'.
 The Spy Chronicles, according to the ministry's statement, contained 'certain contents concerning the national security of Pakistan, being in contravention of the provisions of the Official Secrets Acts, 1923'.
 'It is further highlighted that there are a number of such publications on the way, supported by hostile elements, which contain content to create misperceptions, confusions, question marks against the top leadership circles at country level and to target the common people (sic),' read the ministry's reply.
 According to the document, Durrani had been 'affiliated/interacting with hostile elements, especially Indian RAW, since 2008'.
 It further stated that although he had submitted an affidavit committing to the government to refrain from such activities but the same had still not been seen 'in tangible terms'.
 It said Durrani's name could not be removed from ECL 'at this stage'.
 'The former ISI chief wanted to travel abroad with the intention of participating in international conferences, forums and talks, which will have serious national security implications as evident from the recently published book 'Honour Among Spies', which was also authored by Durrani and published through Indian publishers/RAW supported elements,' the defence ministry said.
 Moreover, the ministry stated, the petitioner also appeared on social media on October 12 and 13, 2020, and expressed his views which cannot be well received by any patriotic citizen.
 While noting that Durrani had remained part of the army for 32 years and served on important and sensitive positions, the ministry said: 'It was inappropriate of his stature to co-author a book, that too with an ex-Indian RAW chief and Indian journalist, on matters concerning the national security of the country'¦ Hence, a sufficient cause for placing the petitioner's name on ECL exists.
' The ministry said after Durrani's book was evaluated from a 'security perspective', it was confirmed by the Court of Inquiry that it contained contents 'which were against the interests of Pakistan'.
 It asserted that no fundamental right of the petitioner had been infringed upon by the placement of his name on the no-fly list, saying: 'If a citizen, which includes a person performing function[s] in connection with the affairs of the state, does not obey the constitutional commands, then he is not performing his obligation imposed by the Constitution.
' Durrani's petition will be taken up again by the HC on February 12.
 In February 2019, the Pakistan Army had announced that Durrani had been found guilty of violating the military's code of conduct and a Court of Inquiry was ordered against him for writing the book.
 A military court subsequently stripped him of his pension and other post-retirement benefits.
 Durrani then challenged that order before the Lahore HC.
 In October 2020, Durrani informed the HC that the government had restored his pension.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka on Friday launched its national coronavirus immunisation campaign by administering the first shots to frontline health workers, soldiers and security personnel, a day after India gifted 500,000 doses of Covishield vaccine to the island nation.
 Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday thanked India for its generosity after he received 500,000 doses of Covishield vaccine donated by the country under the 'Neighbourhood First' policy.
 The consignment was packed in 42 boxes.
 Rajapaksa was joined at the airport by the Indian envoy in Colombo Gopal Baglay.
 Frontline health workers, the Army and Police are on the priority list to receive the coronavirus vaccine, the Colombo Gazette reported.
 The coronavirus vaccination programme will begin at six hospitals in and around Colombo.
 The first jabs were given to three soldiers at the Army Hospital in Colombo, the report said.
 Senior Consultant Physician at the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) in Angoda Dr.
 Ananda Wijewickrama became the first healthcare official to receive the vaccine, it said.
 The Health Ministry said earlier that the vaccination programme will be carried out on the staff at six hospitals on Friday, the report added.
 Health Services deputy director general Dr.
 Hemantha Herath said that selected staff at the Colombo National Hospital, Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Colombo North Teaching Hospital, Homagama Base Hospital, Colombo East Base Hospital and the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) in Angoda will be vaccinated, the report added.
 He said that around 25 per cent of the staff at these hospitals will be vaccinated at the start.
 A total of 250,000 people, mostly health frontline workers, members of the security forces and police and the vulnerable aged, will get the vaccine on a priority basis.
 Sri Lanka has recorded more than 61,000 coronavirus cases so far with 297 deaths.
 India is one of the world's biggest drug-makers and an increasing number of countries have already approached it for procuring the coronavirus vaccines.
 The Oxford-Astrazeneca's Covishield vaccine is manufactured by Serum Institute of India.
 This has been approved for emergency use by the Sri Lankan government.
 The gift from India is in line with India's continued support to Sri Lanka in fighting the COVID pandemic.
 Four consignments of medical supplies weighing around 25 tonnes were donated by India, which also organised online experience-sharing programmes for Sri Lankan medical professionals.
 The two nations have also put up a joint front in the COVID-19 battle with India and Sri Lanka being the largest contributors to the COVID-19 Emergency Fund for SAARC.
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had complimented Sri Lanka's leadership on containing the pandemic.

WASHINGTON: No decision has been made about the future presence of the US troops in Afghanistan, the Pentagon has said, asserting that the Biden administration is committed to responsibly end the war in the strife-torn country with the diplomatic process.
 The previous Trump administration had signed the peace deal with Taliban in February last in Doha.
 The accord drew up plans for withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the insurgent group.
 As part of the deal, the US committed to withdraw its 12,000 troops from Afghanistan within 14 months.
 There are currently only 2,500 American troops left in the war-torn country.
 'We obviously are still committed to ending this war, but we want to do it in a responsible way, and I don't think it's helpful to be drawn now into specific hypothetical questions about the troop numbers on a specific calendar basis,' John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said on Thursday.
 "We are still committed to ending this war, and we obviously, the president has made it clear he wants to bring American troops home from Afghanistan, but we are going to do it in lockstep with the diplomatic process to try to find a negotiated settlement,' he said.
 'If any decision of force levels in Afghanistan is going to be driven by our security requirements there, our security commitments there and driven by conditions, and I think we have been very clear about that.
 They will be conditions-based.
 We obviously want to see a responsible end to this war.
 We obviously want to see successful negotiated settlements to end it,' he said.
 Responding to a question, Kirby said the Taliban are not meeting their commitments to reduce violence and to renounce their ties to al-Qaida, and they're not meeting their commitments.
 'As long as they are not meeting their commitments, it's going to be difficult for anybody at that negotiating table to meet their commitments.
 In fact, it wouldn't be the wise course,' he said.
 The United States, Kirby said, is still involved in trying to get a negotiated settlement.
 'The Taliban have not met their commitments.
 As you know, there is a looming deadline of early May that is before everybody in terms of wanting to have a solution here,' he said.
 'But without them meeting their commitments to renounce the terrorism and to stop the violent attacks on the Afghan national security forces and by dint of that the Afghan people, it's very hard to see a specific way forward for the negotiated settlement.
 But we're still committed to that.
 There's no question about that,' he said.
 Defence secretary Lloyd Austin has been clear in testimony that the US needs to find a reasonable rational end to this war, and that it's got to be done through a negotiated settlement.
 That includes the Afghan government having to be involved in this.
 And thus far, the Taliban has been, to put it politely, reticent to meet their requirements, Kirby said.
 Both General Miller, the commander in Afghanistan, and of course the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley has made it clear that they believe that that is a sufficient number to accomplish the mission, which is largely a counterterrorism mission right now, he said, adding that there are many NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) partners in Afghanistan as well.
 'There hasn't been any decisions made now about what that force presence is going to look like going forward.
 I would say this to leaders of the Taliban, that it is going to be--they make it that much more difficult for final decisions to be made about force presence by their reticence to commit to reasonable, sustainable, and credible negotiations at the table,' Kirby said.
 The Taliban is committed to prevent other groups, including Al Qaeda, from using Afghan soil to recruit, train or fund raise toward activities that threaten the US or its allies.
 Although the Taliban stopped attacks on international forces as part of the historic deal, it continued to fight the Afghan government.
 As a condition of starting talks with the Afghan government, the Taliban demanded that thousands of their members be released in a prisoner swap.
 Direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban began in Doha in September last year, but a breakthrough is yet to be reached.
 Levels of violence in Afghanistan remain high with journalists, activists, politicians and women judges among those killed in targeted assassinations.

ISLAMABAD: The Afghan government on Saturday welcomed the move by the Biden administration to review the February 2020 deal that Washington had signed with Taliban insurgents.
 Sediq Sediqqi, spokesperson of Afghan President Dr Ashraf Ghani, said in a statement that the US-Taliban agreement has so far failed to deliver the desired goal of ending Taliban violence and bringing a ceasefire.
 'The Taliban did not live up to its commitments,' he said.
 His statement followed a phone conversation between Jake Sullivan, the new US national security adviser, and his Afghan counterpart Hamdullah Mohib.
 The Biden administration on Friday said that it was looking to review the deal between Washington and the Taliban.
 In the conversation with Sullivan, Mohib said that they agreed to work towards a permanent ceasefire and a just and durable peace in Afghanistan 'capable of preserving the gains of the past two decades, protecting the rights of all Afghans, and continuing the reforms.
' In a series of tweets on Saturday, Mohib said that Sullivan affirmed that the partnership with the government of Afghanistan and Afghan security and defense forces remains a priority and a key to US national security objectives.
 'We will continue close consultations in the days and weeks ahead,' he added.
 Last week, following the targeted assassination of two female judges in the capital Kabul, the US Embassy warned the Taliban to cease attacks on civilians for peace to come to Afghanistan.
 'The Taliban should understand that such actions for which it bears responsibility outrage the world and must cease if peace is to come to Afghanistan,' tweeted Ross Wilson, the US chargÃ© d'affaires.
 The review comes amid the stalled intra-Afghan talks in the Qatari capital of Doha, which aimed at ending the nearly two-decade conflict in war-torn Afghanistan.
 Former US President Donald Trump had made the withdrawal of US Nato troops from Afghanistan a priority.
 According to the US-Taliban deal, the US and Nato allies would withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by May this year if the Taliban upheld its promises.
 The promises included not to allow militant outfits to operate from areas controlled by the Taliban, shunning violence and to start dialogue with the government in Kabul.
 Following the deal, the militants halted attacks to a greater extent on foreign troops but intensified its fight against Kabul, with the country having seen a wave of targeted killings in recent months.
 Journalists, activists, politicians and women judges were among those killed in targeted assassinations.
 Given the volatile situation in the war-torn country, the new US administration has said that it will review a peace deal that President Trump had made with the Taliban.

KATHMANDU: Nepal's Election Commission has refused to recognise any of the two factions of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) as the official party, saying both failed to adopt due procedures to gain the legitimate status.
 The election commission in its decision on Sunday stated that since both the groups ' one led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal "Prachanda" and other by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli ' failed to adopt due procedures, they would not gain any recognition.
 With the latest decision of the election commission, Oli and Prachanda remain the chairpersons despite a vertical split in the party.
 The Prachanda-led faction had earlier removed Oli from the post of chairman and picked Madhav Kumar Nepal in his place.
 The faction on Sunday decided to strip Oli of even the party's general membership.
 The Prachanda-led faction claimed that they should be recognised as the official NCP as they command the majority in the party's Secretariat, Standing Committee, and Central Committee.
 EC officials said it is difficult to bring any amendments, changes, or reshuffle in the record as demanded by both the factions of the NCP as per the party's statute.
 The ruling NCP saw a vertical split across the party's committees after Prime Minister Oli decided to dissolve the House of Representatives and announced midterm elections for April 30 and May 10.
 Both Oli and Prachanda factions have been holding mass gatherings and other party activities to show their strength.

LONDON: : Two British Labour Sikh MPs are facing criticism for failing to condemn the violence after having openly supported the farmers' protests in Delhi which on Republic Day ended in anarchy with the Sikh religious flag, the Nishan Sahib, being raised at Red Fort, one farmer protester dead and hundreds of police officers injured.
 On Tuesday, in the midst of the rioting, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi an MP who has roots in Raipur, Jalandhar, tweeted: 'Sad to see scenes of clashes between some protesters and police in Delhi #FarmersProtest.
 Notable though the huge #TractorParade today and ongoing months long struggle (largest protest currently in the world) have been peaceful and inspired so many struggling for an existence.
' Shadow international development secretary Preet Gill, whose family hails from Jamsher in Jalandhar, tweeted: 'It's heart-breaking to see the scenes from Delhi.
 All citizens have the right to peacefully protest.
 The Internet has been shut down after police fired at protestors.
 #IStandWithFarmers.
' UK-based Manoj Ladwa, Narendra Modi's former communications director and founder and chair, India Inc.
 Group, tweeted an image of a Sikh protester threatening a police officer with a sword, saying: 'This is hardly an image of Gandhian peaceful protest @PreetKGillMP @TanDhesi! Will you condemn those who resorted to premeditated violence, attacked police officers, misused sacred religious symbols - all on the day when India was celebrating its democracy? #IStandWithFarmersToo.
' An investment professional and dealmaker covering India, Alpesh B.
 Patel, tweeted the same image, comparing it to the January 6 storming of the US Capitol, saying: 'Just as the armed militants who raided the US Congress, promoted by Trump to do so, should not disgrace all Republicans, so this armed militant should not disgrace all farmers, promoted by some UK politicians'¦ No thanks militants.
 Liberalism + Democracy.
' Patel also quote-tweeted Gill's tweet, saying: 'You don't get away with playing victim.
 Not Trump supporters raiding Congress and not your supporters wanting their own theocratic separate ISIS-like State.

UK PM Boris Johnson hopes schools in England can reopen on March 8

LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson indicated Wednesday that the coronavirus lockdown in England will remain in place until at least March 8 as he ruled out any imminent return to school for most students.
 In a statement to lawmakers, Johnson also confirmed new restrictions for travelers arriving in England from countries deemed to be high-risk.
 He said the UK remains in a "perilous situation'' with more than 37,000 patients hospitalized with Covid-19, nearly double the number during the country's previous peak in April.
 While dashing any hopes that students would return to classrooms after a mid-February school break, Johnson said the March 8 aspiration is based on progress on the vaccination front.
 "The first sign of normality beginning to return should be pupils going back to their classrooms," he said.
 England's schools are currently closed to all students bar those deemed to be vulnerable and children of key workers, such as doctors and delivery drivers.
 Schools are also closed in the other nations of the UK Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
 Johnson said he hoped that by mid-February, much more will be known about the effect of vaccines in preventing hospital admissions and deaths, and the government plans to publish a plan for the "gradual and phased'' easing of the lockdown in the week commencing February 22.
 "If we achieve our target of vaccinating everyone in the four most vulnerable groups with their first dose by Feb.
 15, and every passing day sees more progress towards that goal, then those groups will have developed immunity from the virus about three weeks later, that is, by March 8," Johnson said.
 Because the government has consistently said schools would be the first part of society to reopen from lockdown, Johnson's announcement clearly points to shops selling non-essential items and pubs and restaurants remaining closed for even longer.
 Johnson also set out tougher measures to prevent the arrival of new variants of the coronavirus into England, confirming plans for a 10-day quarantine in hotels or other government-provided accommodation for travelers from high-risk countries.
 He said discussions are taking place for the restrictions to apply in the other UK nations, too.
 On Tuesday, the UK became the fifth country in the world to record more than 100,000 coronavirus-related deaths.
 The UK is the smallest country to breach that threshold, and it has one of the world's worst Covid-19-related mortality rates.
 Johnson has come under renewed fire for his handling of the pandemic, with many arguing that he has been too slow in making tough decisions and sidelined scientific advice, particularly in December when a new, more virulent, variant of the coronavirus was identified in London and the southeast of England.
 Critics argue that one failure was not imposing a lockdown throughout England right after scientists informed him on Dec.
 18 that the new variant was up to 70% more infectious than the original coronavirus strain.
 The lockdown only came into force on Jan.
 5, a delay that critics say fueled the rapid increase in new coronavirus infections around the turn of the year, and the subsequent acute pressure on hospitals and deaths.
 "Fifty thousand people have died since Nov.
 11 50,000 deaths in 77 days,'' Keir Starmer, the leader of the main opposition Labour Party, said.
 "In isolation, any of these mistakes are perhaps understandable.
 Taken together it's a damning indictment of how the government has handled this pandemic.
'' Though there's growing evidence to show that the lockdown is bringing down new cases, infections are still running at relatively high levels and would be liable to rise sharply again if restrictions are relaxed too soon and too much.

Poland: Near-total abortion ban takes effect amid protests

TEXT:
WARSAW: A near-total ban on abortion has taken effect in Poland and triggered a new round of nationwide protests three months after a top court ruled that the abortion of congenitally damaged fetuses is unconstitutional.
 Led by a women's rights group, Women's Strike, people poured onto the streets of Warsaw and other cities and towns on Thursday for the second evening in a row.
 "I wanted to have more children, you killed this desire,'' read a banner held by one woman among the demonstrators in Warsaw.
 Some Polish women said that if they are denied the right to terminate pregnancies in cases of badly deformed fetuses, they would not try to have children at all.
 Poland's top human rights official denounced the further restriction of what was already one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, calling it a tragedy for women.
 "The state wants to further limit their rights, risk their lives, and condemn them to torture,'' said Adam Bodnar, the human rights commissioner, or ombudsman, whose role is independent from the Polish government.
 "This offensive is opposed by civil society.
'' The only remaining legal justifications for abortion under Polish law are if the woman's life or health is at risk or if a pregnancy results from rape or incest.
 To date, about 98% of all legal abortions in the country - of which there were 1,110 in 2019 - were performed on the grounds of fetal malformations.
 The restriction of abortion comes amid a broader erosion of civil liberties under right-wing populist authorities in Poland, as well as Hungary.
 The erosion of democratic rights in the two nations also is spreading to other parts of ex-communist central Europe, presenting a challenge for the European Union and US President Joe Biden as he seeks to restore democratic norms at home and abroad.
 Poland's constitutional court on Wednesday issued a justification of a controversial October ruling that bans abortions in cases of fetuses with congenital defects, even ones so severe that there is no chance of survival upon birth.
 The government then published the court's ruling in a government Journal of Laws.
 Those steps were the formal prerequisites required for the new law to enter into force.
 Members of Poland's ruling Law and Justice party, which is aligned with the Roman Catholic Church, had sought the new restriction.
 They argued that it was a way to prevent the abortion of fetuses with Down syndrome, which have made up a significant share of the legal abortions in Poland.
 Women's rights activists consider the new law to be draconian.
 The protesters are demanding a full liberalization of the abortion law and the resignation of the government, neither of which seem likely in the short term.
 In the meantime, women's rights groups are seeking new strategies to help women.
 The Federation for Women and Family planning says it will seek redress in international courts, arguing that the new law violates prohibitions of cruel treatment and torture.
 It is also assisting women who want to obtain abortion pills or travel abroad for the procedure.
 Some protesters Wednesday covered their faces with green handkerchiefs, which are the symbol of the abortion rights movement in Argentina.
 The South American country recently legalized abortion, a historic change in deeply Catholic Latin America.
 Amnesty International, calling Poland's law taking effect "a terrible day for women and girls in Poland," said bans never prevent abortions.
 "Instead, they serve only to damage women's health by pushing abortions underground or forcing women to travel to foreign countries to access abortion care they need and to which they have a right,'' Amnesty senior research adviser Esther Major said.
 In a more than 200-page ruling, the constitutional court argued that allowing abortion when there are congenital defects is unconstitutional because the Polish Constitution protects human life.
 The constitutional court is made up mostly of Law and Justice appointees who ruled on a motion brought by lawmakers from the party.

MOSCOW: A Russian court on Thursday ordered Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to be kept in jail, rejecting an appeal against his detention and shrugging off calls by the West and tens of thousands of his Russian supporters for his release.
  Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, was remanded in custody for 30 days on Jan.
 18 after flying back to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent in August.
  A court at the time ordered him detained for alleged parole violations, which he denied.
 With various legal cases pending against him, Navalny, 44, could face years in jail.
 Tens of thousands of Russians protested against his jailing on Saturday.
  Navalny appeared in court on Thursday by video link from jail, railing against what he called absurd allegations trumped up by authorities to sideline him for political reasons.
  "You won't succeed in frightening us.
 We are the majority.
.
.
 I'm happy that more and more people understand that the law is on our side, that we're in the right," he told the presiding judge.
  "We'll never allow .
.
.
 these people to seize and steal our country.
 Yes, brute force is on your side now.
 You can.
.
.
put me in handcuffs.
 (But) that will not continue forever," he said.
  Outside the court on the outskirts of Moscow, his lawyer Olga Mikhailova said they would appeal against the ruling to keep him in custody.
  After the ruling was handed down, Navalny told the judge with trademark sarcasm: "Everything was clear to me before the start of the court hearing, thank you.
"  Navalny's allies have called for new protests this weekend to demand his release.
 The authorities have said any demonstrations will be illegal and will be broken up.
 SEARCHES OF SUPPORTERS' HOMES Russia's prison service has accused Navalny of breaking the terms of a suspended sentence he had been serving on embezzlement charges that he says were trumped up.
  A court hearing on Feb.
 2 is set to consider converting that sentence into a three-and-a-half year prison term.
  Last weekend police detained just over 4,000 people at demonstrations calling for his release in Moscow and dozens of other cities, according to a protest monitoring group.
 Authorities have followed up with a sweeping crackdown.
  Late on Wednesday, police carried out searches at the homes of Navalny's supporters and other properties linked to him, detaining several people, including his brother Oleg for allegedly breaching COVID-19 safety restrictions.
  Russian investigators said on Thursday they had opened a criminal case into Leonid Volkov, a close Navalny ally, for allegedly urging teenagers to take part in what it said were illegal protests on Saturday.
  Navalny has accused Putin of being responsible for his poisoning with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent last summer.
 The Kremlin has denied any involvement.

MOSCOW: Several allies of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny were taken into custody early on Thursday after their apartments and offices were searched by police ahead of planned demonstrations.
 Navalny's aides indicated that the searches were connected to a criminal probe launched by the interior ministry over alleged violations of coronavirus restrictions during protests last week.
 The searches come as the opposition called for fresh demonstrations on Sunday to demand freedom for Navalny, who was arrested on his return from Germany, where he spent months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning.
 Ivan Zhdanov, the head of Navalny's FBK Anti-Corruption Foundation, said prominent aide Lyubov Sobol and Navalny's brother Oleg were detained for 48 hours as suspects.
 Sobol's lawyer Vladimir Voronin said both she and Oleg Navalny were questioned by police during the night.
 Searches were also carried out in the flat of Navalny's wife Yulia and in the office of FBK, Navalny's organisation, which is known for its investigations into the wealth of Russia's elites.
 Police also arrived at the home of Navalny's doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva and she too was taken into custody for 48 hours.
 In a video posted on Twitter by Vasilyeva's press secretary, the doctor is playing Beethoven on the piano as people in uniform arrive at the door.
 According to Mediazona, a news website that focuses on opposition detentions, police carried out at least 18 searches on Wednesday.
 Last weekend tens of thousands of Russians across the country rallied in support of Navalny who is awaiting a trial that could see him imprisoned for several years on charges of violating a 2014 suspended sentence.
 Navalny's lawyers intend to appeal against his arrest later on Thursday.
 Officials have also ramped up pressure on online platforms for failing to delete posts calling for young people to join the unsanctioned rallies.
 Protests in Russia are banned if they are not approved by the authorities, as are calls for people under 18 to join in.
 The Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said on Thursday it launched a probe against Leonid Volkov, the head of Navalny's regional network, for persuading minors to commit "illegal actions".
 The opposition plans to hold more rallies on Sunday, which in Moscow will take place outside the headquarters of the FSB, the security agency that Navalny says targeted him with a near-fatal poisoning attack.
 More than 3,900 people were detained last Saturday at the unsanctioned rallies, which have sparked a series of criminal investigations.

WHO-led team in Wuhan probing Covid origins meet Chinese scientists

BEIJING: A World Health Organization-led team of experts investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic began meeting with Chinese scientists on Friday, and the WHO said the group plans to visit labs, markets and hospitals in Wuhan.
 On Thursday, the team completed two weeks of quarantine following its arrival in China, moving to a lakeside hotel in the central Chinese city where the deadly virus emerged in late 2019.
 "First face to face meeting with our colleagues.
 Correction: facemask to facemask given the medical restrictions.
 Discussing our visiting program," Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, tweeted on Friday.
 "China teamleader prof Wannian joking about some technical glitches.
 Nice to see our colleagues after lengthy zoom meetings," she said.
 The group is expected to spend two more weeks in China, and will visit the seafood market at the centre of the early outbreak.
 It will also visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
 One hypothesis, rejected by China, is that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the government lab.
 The WHO has sought to manage expectations.
 "There are no guarantees of answers," its emergency chief, Mike Ryan, said earlier this month.
 The mission has been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between China and the United States, which has accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.
 "It is important to remember that the success of this mission and origin-tracing is 100% depending on access to the relevant sources," Thea Fischer, a Danish member of the team, told Reuters on Thursday.
 "No matter how competent we are, how hard we work and how many stones we try to turn, this can only be possible with the support from China," she said.
 The origin of Covid-19 has been highly politicised.
 The investigating team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which former US President Donald Trump accused of being "China-centric".
 China has pushed the idea that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, with state media citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers saying it had been circulating in Europe in 2019.
 China's foreign ministry has also hinted that the sudden closure of a US army laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland in July 2019 was linked to the pandemic.
 "At the early stage in China, it was a burden particularly for Wuhan people when everyone was calling it a Wuhan virus, which was humiliating," said Yang You, a 30-year-old Wuhan resident.
 "If it could be traced to the source clearly, in my opinion, it could clear either China's or Wuhan's name.
"

BEIJING: China toughened its language towards Taiwan on Thursday, warning after recent stepped up military activities near the island that "independence means war" and that their armed forces were taking action to respond to provocation and foreign interference.
 Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, reported multiple Chinese fighter jets and bombers entering Taiwan's southwestern air defence identification zone over the weekend, prompting concern in Washington.
 China believes that Taiwan's democratically-elected government is moving the island towards a declaration of formal independence, though President Tsai Ing-wen has repeatedly said they are already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.
 Asked at a monthly news briefing about the air forces' recent activities, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said Taiwan was an inseparable part of China.
 "The military activities carried out by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Taiwan Strait are necessary actions to address the current security situation in the Taiwan Strait and to safeguard national sovereignty and security," he said.
 "They are a solemn response to external interference and provocations by 'Taiwan independence' forces," he added.
 The Chinese incursions coincided with a U.
S.
 carrier battle group entering the disputed South China Sea to promote "freedom of the seas".
 Wu said a "handful" of people in Taiwan were seeking the island's independence.
 "We warn those 'Taiwan independence' elements: those who play with fire will burn themselves, and 'Taiwan independence' means war," he added.

WUHAN, China: A team of experts from the World Health Organization left quarantine in Wuhan on Thursday to begin a heavily scrutinised probe into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, after Washington urged a "robust and clear" investigation.

 The WHO insists the visit will be tightly tethered to the science of how the virus -- which has killed more than two million people and laid waste to the global economy -- jumped from animals to humans.
 But in a sign of the political baggage attached to their mission, US President Joe Biden's new administration weighed in before the experts had even left their hotel.
 Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, new White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said it was "imperative we get to the bottom" of how the virus appeared and spread worldwide.
 Psaki voiced concern over "misinformation" from "some sources in China" and urged a "robust and clear" probe.
 In a mission dogged by delays and obfuscation from their Chinese hosts, it was not clear what the expert team will be allowed to see in Wuhan -- or what useful evidence remains a year after the outbreak in a country which has vigorously controlled the narrative of how the pandemic began.
 The early days of the outbreak remain among the most sensitive topics in China today, with the Communist leadership seeking to stamp out any discussion that shows its governance in a poor light.
 Beijing has also sought to seed doubt into the origin story, floating the unsubstantiated theory that the virus emerged elsewhere.
 Another theory, amplified by former US President Donald Trump, is that it leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan where researchers were studying coronaviruses.
 Relatives of Wuhan's coronavirus dead have called for a meeting with the team from the UN health agency, saying they have been facing new levels of official obstruction since the WHO team arrived.
 They accuse the Chinese government of taking down a WeChat group used by scores of next-of-kin to discuss the outbreak shortly after the WHO team arrived.
 "This shows that (Chinese authorities) are very nervous.
 They are afraid that these families will get in touch with the WHO experts," said Zhang Hai, 51, whose father died early in the pandemic of suspected Covid-19.
 Relatives accuse the Wuhan city and Hubei provincial governments of allowing Covid-19 to burst beyond control by trying to conceal the outbreak when it first emerged in the city in December 2019, then failing to alert the public and bungling the response.
 According to official Chinese figures it killed nearly 3,900 in Wuhan, accounting for the vast majority of the 4,636 dead China has reported.
 A panel of independent experts concluded this month that China and the WHO could have acted more quickly to avert catastrophe during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak.

 Residents and tourists, barring UAE nationals, must now present a valid negative Covid-19 PCR test certificate for a test taken no more than 72 hours before departure from January 31.
 According to the new protocols by Dubai government, passengers arriving at Dubai airport UAE citizens will be required to do a PCR test on arrival regardless of the country they are coming from and UAE residents, GCC citizens and visitors need to do a pre travel RT-PCR, irrespective of the country they are coming from.
 Also, arrivals from some countries, depending on the Covid situation there, may be required to undergo additional tests when landing in Dubai, according to Air India Express officials.
 The mandatory 72-hour time frame begins from the time the swab was collected for the test.
 AIE officials said that on January 31, February 1 and 2, their flights from Mangaluru will land at Sharjah, instead of Dubai, due to some issues and cautioned travelers to follow the 72 hour window since they have not received any communication from the Sharjah Government regarding RT-PCR validity window.
 Apart from a valid negative Covid-19 test report for passengers travelling to the UAE, AI Express has again cautioned passengers the test report should be present in the printed (original) form, from a govt-approved lab in India (ICMR/ Pure Health/Micro Health accredited laboratories).
 Apart from this, UAE residents who have Dubai issued residence visa must obtain GDRFA approval before travelling through and UAE residents holding residence visa issued through any other emirate are required to get ICA approval to verify the authenticity of their travel.

BEIRUT: Lebanese security forces opened fire in violent clashes Wednesday with dozens of protesters who took to the street in the country's north for a third consecutive day to denounce deteriorating living conditions amid a strict lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
 At least one protester was hit by live ammunition and fell to the ground, blood pouring from his thigh.
 Police said they were responding to hand grenades thrown by the protesters that injured nine policemen, including three officers.
 The violence marked a sharp escalation in confrontations in the northern city of Tripoli that began on Monday and continued for three straight days into Wednesday night.
 The city is the second largest in Lebanon, and the most impoverished.
 Earlier, police fired tear gas and water cannons at dozens of young men who tried to storm a government building in the city.
 The Red Cross, in a statement, said its volunteers transported 11 people to hospital, while 63 others were lightly injured and treated on the spot.
 Amid a dramatic surge in coronavirus infections, the government has imposed a nearly month-long nationwide lockdown and round-the-clock curfew, the strictest since the virus hit Lebanon.
 The measures have exacerbated a crippling economic and financial crisis that preceded the pandemic in this small Mediterranean country of nearly 5 million people and over 1 million refugees.
 The Lebanese currency has tumbled, losing over 80% of its value.
 Banks have imposed controls on withdrawals and transfers to protect dwindling foreign reserves.
 Unemployment and inflation have skyrocketed and tens of thousands have been thrown into poverty.
 On Wednesday, Lebanon hit a new daily record for Covid-19 fatalities, registering 76 deaths Hospitals are struggling with COVID-19 patients, reporting near full occupancy in ICU beds.
 Nearly 290,000 infections have been recorded since last February and 2,553 deaths.
 The protests are also a reflection of the political divisions and deep frustration at politicians who have been deadlocked over the formation of a new government for nearly six months.
 The government resigned in August following a massive blast at Beirut's port, which killed over 200 people and injured thousands.
 Lebanon's ruling class has faced rising popular anger since protesters took to the streets in October 2019, in the largest-ever nationwide protests in the country.
 Demonstrators accused them of mismanaging and robbing the country of its resources and driving it into poverty.
 The protests later died down, in part because of the pandemic but also because the political class held on to power and divisions emerged among the demonstrators.
 On Wednesday, Lebanese officials unveiled the national vaccination plan, saying the government aims to inoculate around 80% of the population by the end of the year.
 The first batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines is scheduled to arrive in Lebanon by mid-February.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia will host a two-day Davos-style investment forum starting Wednesday, with dozens of global policy makers and business tycoons lined up to speak at the partly virtual event amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 Around 150 speakers will participate in the fourth edition of the Future Investment Initiative (FII), organisers said, seeking to showcase the insular kingdom as a dynamic investment destination.
 Around 100 speakers will participate virtually from FII hubs in New York, Paris, Beijing and Mumbai and 50 will attend the conference in-person in Riyadh, they added.
 The participants include Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon, Stephen Schwarzman, head of private equity firm Blackstone, American asset management company Blackrock's chief executive Larry Fink and former Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt, organisers said.
 The summit, earlier slated to be held last October, comes amid the pandemic that has battered the global economy.
 "There has never been a more important time for leaders, investors and policy makers to come together to work towards re-energising the global economy," Yasir al-Rumayyan, chairman of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, said in a statement.
 The summit, dubbed "Davos in the desert", was launched by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2017 to woo foreign investors and promote his Vision 2030 diversification plan to wean the economy off its dependence on petro-dollars.
 But the following year, the fallout over journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder by Saudi agents in Istanbul prompted a wave of business and political leaders to pull out of the glitzy conference at the last minute.
 The murder at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul triggered one of the top crude exporter's worst ever diplomatic and public relations crises.
 The conference saw a reboot in 2019 as global outrage over the murder subsided.
 The forum is billed as an economic coming-out party for the petro-state, seeking to diversify away from oil -- and authorities are eager to project the kingdom's economic ambitions.

HAIFA, Israel: When the face of 86-year-old Holocaust survivor Naomie Lichthaus appeared on their screen, staff at the call centre of Israel's Yad Ezer La-Haver foundation were ready to respond.
 The foundation established by Shimon Shabag in the northern port city of Haifa in 2001 has been supporting survivors of the Nazis for two decades but its mission has expanded during the Covid-19 pandemic.
 On Holocaust Remembrance Day, 76 years since the liberation of the Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz, Holocaust survivors find themselves vulnerable to a virus that preys on the elderly and has forced many into painful isolation.
 Before the pandemic, Yad Ezer ran a home for about 100 survivors while providing food as well as medical and psychological assistance to others who lived independently.
 But in October it expanded to include a round-the-clock call centre with electronic monitoring, installing tablets in people's homes to allow for rapid, direct communication.
 "We call more than 3,500 people a day," Shabag told AFP.
 "We talk to them.
 We show them that we are here and that we're taking care of them.
" There are an estimated 180,000 Holocaust survivors living in Israel, according to official data.
 Among them is Lichthaus, who was born in Chernivtsi, a city which falls in present day Ukraine.
 She said when World War II broke out she was only six but would "never forget" the horror she experienced, including when men burst into her home and carried out a brutal anti-Semitic assault on her mother.
 She lives alone now and said her calls with Yad Ezer offer comfort.
 "They ask me if I need anything or if I want to talk," she said, explaining that she recently asked for a mobility walker.
 After disconnecting with Lichthaus, foundation volunteer Mourad Marehi was headed to her home on a motorbike to deliver the walker.
 "I feel more secure walking around now," Lichthaus said after receiving the delivery, her weight supported by the device.
 Shabag said that if someone doesn't answer a call to their tablet, "we immediately send one of our bikers" to see what's going on.
 On multiple occasions, the foundation has found someone lying on the floor following a stroke, a heart attack or a fall, he explained.
 Shabag told AFP that many survivors had been suffering from financial distress and other hardships like loneliness independent of the pandemic.
 The traumas brought on by the virus, especially "the fear" of lacking the essentials needed to survive, had triggered painful war-era memories, he said.
 The home run by Yad Ezer near the call centre is on Haifa's Kassel Street, but is known to locals as "survivors street".
 One resident is Holocaust survivor Haya Caspi, an 88-year-old of Romanian origin who lost her parents during the war.
 "It's hard because we're alone, but.
.
.
 we are lucky because they take care of us," she said.

Why the West is ditching cloth masks, nose swabs

On his last day in office, Robert Redfield, chief of America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under Donald Trump, was asked how he had been keeping himself safe on flights without getting vaccinated.
 'You know, I believe if I wear my mask, wash my hands and social distance, I can fly safely,' Redfield told The New York Times.
 We seem to have forgotten masks since the results of vaccine trials started coming out in early-November, but they remain just as important for stopping Covid as they were a year ago.
 In fact, they might be more important now because of the new risk from mutant viruses that spread faster, evade antibodies in people who have already had Covid, and also make vaccines less effective.
 You can gauge how contagious these viruses are from the way the UK variant has spread in Denmark despite a strict lockdown.
 In the last week of December, the UK variant was found in only 2.
4% of Danish samples, but by the third week of January, its share had increased to 12.
1%.
 Meanwhile, the Brazil variant has surfaced in Germany and the US, and the South African variant has sent vaccine makers back to the lab.
 American firm Moderna announced on Monday it will make a booster dose of its mRNA vaccine based on the South African variant.
 Better Masks NeededEurope, which is battling a deadly winter surge of Covid cases, is now setting the standard for mask use.
 While Germany earlier allowed any kind of face covering, including homemade cloth masks, now medical-grade masks ' N95, KN95, FFP2 or a surgical mask ' are mandatory on public transport.
 In Austria, only N95 or equivalent masks are allowed inside public transport and stores since last Monday.
 Last week, France also banned all cloth masks in public ' including workplaces ' unless they meet 'category 1' standards, which means filtering 95% of 3-micrometre particles.
 With Covid on the wane in India, some might roll their eyes at this 'abundance of caution', but if the new virus variants from the UK, Brazil and South Africa start driving up case numbers again in India, we will be better off following Europe's example.
 Cloth masks do a good job of trapping your own respiratory particles but are not able to filter the air you breathe in very well.
 They are effective against the coronavirus only when everyone in a train or a store uses them.
 When that's not the case, you need to choose a better mask to protect yourself.
 As Markus SÃ¶der, the state premier of Bavaria in Germany, tells The Washington Post: 'If the virus becomes more dangerous, the mask has to get better.
' Stop Swabbing Noses?At the Thailand Open earlier this month, Indian shuttler Kidambi Srikanth was left with a bleeding nose after undergoing four Covid tests.
 If you have taken a nasal swab yourself for an RT-PCR test, you will know how unpleasant they can be.
 But are they necessary? A 'nasal' swab actually digs beyond the nose, into the nasopharyngeal area, where the chances of picking up the coronavirus are higher.
 However, a recent article in 'Annals of Internal Medicine' says saliva is a 'similarly sensitive and less costly' way to collect samples for Covid tests.
 A saliva sample can be given by simply spitting into a receptacle, without the need for a nurse in PPE.
 Research at Yale University also shows saliva samples give a better idea of how sick a person might get from Covid because saliva reflects the viral load in the lower respiratory tract ' trachea and lungs ' while nose swabs show how much virus is present in the upper respiratory tract, which is important for passing on the disease to others.
 Are Oximeters Reliable?Pulse oximeters were hot sellers at the height of the pandemic in India.
 People quarantined at home after testing positive needed them to ensure their blood oxygen level didn't fall below the safe limit.
 But an article in the journal 'Chemical and Engineering News' raises a question about the reliability of these devices for dark-skinned people.
 A pulse oximeter works by emitting red and infrared light, which are 'absorbed at different rates by the oxygen-bound and oxygen-free forms of haemoglobin' in blood.
 The light has to shine through skin, and if the user is dark-skinned, the meter can overestimate the level of blood oxygen, the article says.
 'In many cases, when arterial oxygen saturation was below 88%, the meters showed 92-96%'.
 The article says oximeter manufacturers need to account for 'the uneven way that skin, bones, blood and tissue disperse red light.
'

Myanmar army chief's rhetoric fuels fears of a coup

YANGON: Myanmar's army chief has raised the prospect of scrapping the country's constitution as fears swirl about a possible coup by the military over electoral fraud concerns.
 The army has for weeks alleged widespread voter irregularities in November's election, which Aung San Suu Kyi's ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) won in a landslide.
 The civilian administration has been in an uneasy power-sharing agreement with the army generals since Myanmar's first democratic elections in 2015, as dictated by a 2008 junta-authored constitution.
 An army spokesman on Tuesday refused to rule out the possibility of the military seizing total power to deal with what he called a political crisis.
 And on Thursday General Min Aung Hlaing -- arguably Myanmar's most powerful individual -- appeared to echo that sentiment in a speech published in the military-run Myawady newspaper.
 The army chief said the 2008 constitution was "the mother law for all laws" and should be respected.
 But he warned that in certain circumstances it could be "necessary to revoke the constitution".
 The comments follow repeated demands by the army for Myanmar's election commission to release final voter lists from the November polls, a demand that has not been met.
 The military says the lists are required to cross-check for irregularities.
 It alleges there were 8.
6 million cases of voter fraud nationwide.
 The polls were only the second democratic elections Myanmar has had since emerging in 2011 from a nearly five-decade military dictatorship.
 Long a popular figure in Myanmar, Suu Kyi's run for power in historic 2015 elections was curbed by several constitutional provisions.
 One provision barred any citizen married to a foreigner from becoming president.
 Suu Kyi, who married a British citizen, sidestepped that rule after the 2015 election win by becoming state counsellor -- a de facto leadership role created by her government.
 The NLD also then pushed for changes to the constitution in their first term, a process that has made little progress.
 Political analyst Soe Myint Aung said the army saw "major loopholes (in the constitution) that has caused its detriment".
 "The coup rhetoric is not merely a bluff or empty threat," he said.
 Even if it does not orchestrate a "fully fledged" takeover of power, "it is likely the military will take some action unless the (election commission) and the government redress the election-related grievances.
" Suu Kyi has made no direct comment on the military's polling complaints.
 The last time the country saw its constitution revoked was in 1962 and 1988 -- both when the military seized power and reinstated a junta government.

JOHANNESBURG: There is no need to cover the coffins of people who died of Covid-19 in plastic wraps or mark them with biohazard stickers prior to burial, the South African Department of Health said.
 "The Department of Health has issued health directions on the management of human remains that died of Covid-19 that prescribes measures to be implemented.
 These directions do not prescribe the covering of coffins with plastics, use of biohazard stickers nor wearing full PPE by funeral directors or sanitising of the graves or clothes of people attending the funeral as this is unnecessary," the department said in a press release.
 Wrapping coffins in plastic is only necessary for parts of South Africa with high water saturation in the soil and normally comes as a separate ordinance from the local authorities in relation to all burials, not only those related to Covid-19, according to the press release.
 The South African health authority also cited revised guidance from the World Health Organization as indicating that "transmission of SARS 2 from a human remain to people who are alive has not been proven.
" The health department stressed that the number of people attending burial ceremonies still had government-set limits to prevent the spread of the virus.
 As of Thursday, South Africa confirmed over 1.
4 million Covid-19 cases, including 42,550 deaths.

JAKARTA: Hundreds of Rohingya are missing from a refugee camp in Indonesia and are believed to have been trafficked to neighbouring Malaysia, officials and sources said Thursday.
 Just 112 refugees remain at the makeshift camp in Lhokseumawe on Indonesia's northern coast this week, well down from the almost 400 that arrived between June and September last year.
 Neither local authorities nor the UN could account for the whereabouts of the refugees from the stateless Muslim minority from Myanmar, who are feared to have enlisted traffickers to help them cross the Malacca strait into Malaysia.
 "We don't know yet where they went," said Ridwan Jamil, head of the Rohingya taskforce in Lhokseumawe.
 "But they'll escape if they can find any hole to leave because that is their goal.
" A Myanmar military crackdown in 2017, which UN investigators said amounted to genocide, forced 750,000 Rohingya to flee across the border into Bangladesh's southeast coastal district of Cox's Bazar, where many ended up in sprawling refugee camps.
 Thousands have since paid smugglers to get them out of Bangladesh, enduring harrowing, months-long sea journeys punctuated by illness, beatings by traffickers and near starvation rations to reach Indonesia and Malaysia.
 At least 18 Rohingya from the Lhokseumawe camp and over a dozen suspected traffickers were recently apprehended by police several hundred kilometres south in Medan city, a frequent staging point for illegal crossings into Malaysia, authorities said.
 The refugees have been asked not to leave the camp, the UN's refugee agency said, given the risks involved in making the journey.
 "But (they) left despite our constant efforts to remind them about the danger and risks they could face by leaving, including if they used the services of smugglers," said UNHCR spokeswoman Mitra Suryono.
 "But we have to remember that many of (them) have relatives in other countries such as Malaysia.
 That may be one of the reasons why they continued their journey," she added.
 Rights groups blamed the Indonesian government, which drastically reduced security at the settlement when the Rohingya were placed under the supervision of UNHCR last month.
 While Indonesia is not a signatory to an international convention on refugees, the move was a breach of its obligations to protect them, said Usman Hamid, director of Amnesty International's Indonesia office.

'Beautiful' or 'kitsch'?: Massive Belgrade statue stirs controversy

TEXT:
BELGRADE: A gargantuan statue of a medieval Serbian prince unveiled in Belgrade on Wednesday has sparked a fierce debate: is it a "beautiful" tribute to a historical icon or "monstrous" kitsch spoiling a public square? The brightly-lit bronze state of Prince Stefan Nemanja, a 12th-century prince considered the founder of the Serbian state, stands more than 23 metres (75 feet) tall in a riverside Belgrade neighbourhood.
 Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has praised it as "the most beautiful thing" he has ever seen.
 "This monument is big, because our story is big.
 It's heavy because our history often was," Vucic said at the unveiling ceremony, which was attended by hundreds.
 Yet many critics think quite the opposite, with historians, artists and architects slamming the monument as so gaudy that it "trivialises" the history it is meant to represent.
 One prominent architect went as far as to describe it as an act of "urbanistic terrorism".
 "It's monstrous, it's kitsch, and it taints the beautiful train station building", historian Dubravka Stojanovic told local newspaper Danas, referring to the nearby former railway hub, a relic of late 19th-century Serbian architecture, that is now dwarfed by the statue.
 The monument depicts the sombre-faced prince holding a sword as he stands on an enormous cracked Byzantine helmet that is almost half the size of the monument.
 On social media, the image was lampooned as resembling Saruman, a Lord of the Rings character, "standing on a chocolate egg".
 Milja Mladenovic, an urbanism expert, argues that the size of the statue clashes with the spacial layout of the surrounding square, particularly the railway centre which was previously its focal point.
 "When viewed through the design of public space, it is very problematic to find (a statue of) that height in the square," she told AFP.
 A Serbian conservation association unsuccessfully asked authorities to drop the monument, citing its discordance with the neighbourhood and calling for the money to be used for other badly-needed restorations.
 The exact cost of its construction remains unknown.
 City officials have said the price of the monument was declared "confidential" until 2023, a year after Belgrade's next municipal elections.
 The work's creator, Russian artist Alexander Rukavishnikov, said he hoped Serbs would "get used to the monument".
 "Trust me, it won't spoil the appearance of your beautiful Belgrade and I hope they will grow to love it in time," he told public broadcaster RTS.
 Belgrade's deputy mayor Goran Vesi has also come to its defence.
 "There were different opinions on the Eiffel Tower and Statue of Liberty.

 Good artwork always causes different opinions and criticism, and nobody notices the bad ones.

ISTANBUL: A devoted dog has spent days waiting outside a hospital in northern Turkey where her sick owner was receiving treatment.
 The pet, Boncuk (Bon-DJUK), which means bead, followed the ambulance that transported her owner, Cemal Senturk, to hospital in the Black Sea city of Trabzon on January 14.
 She then made daily visits to the facility, private news agency DHA reported on Wednesday.
 Senturk's daughter, Aynur Egeli, said she would take Boncuk home but the dog would repeatedly run off and return to the hospital.
 Hospital security guard Muhammet Akdeniz told DHA: 'She comes every day around 9am and waits until nightfall.
 She doesn't go in.
' 'When the door opens she pokes her head inside,' he said.
 On Wednesday, Boncuk was finally reunited with Senturk when he was pushed outside in a wheelchair for a brief meeting with his dog.
 'She's very used to me.
 And I miss her, too, constantly,' he told DHA.
 Senturk was discharged from the hospital later on Wednesday and returned home with Boncuk.

DES MOINES: The jackpot for the Mega Millions lottery game has grown to $1 billion ahead of Friday night's drawing after more than four months without a winner thanks to bad luck, poor odds and reduced play partially blamed on the coronavirus pandemic.
 It's only the third time a lottery jackpot has grown so large, but much has changed since the last time such a big prize was up for grabs in 2018.
 The odds of winning a jackpot remain the same _ incredibly small _ but for a variety of reasons fewer people are playing Mega Millions or Powerball, the two lottery games offered in most of the country.
 And even as the huge Mega Millions prize and a $731.
1 million Powerball jackpot won Wednesday by a single ticket sold in Maryland have juiced sales for the games, Maryland lottery director Gordon Medenica noted: ``We're not out of the woods yet.
'' Medenica acknowledged sales were dramatically lower before the pandemic, and they tanked even further in the spring and summer.
 After a peak in October 2018, Medenica said sales of the big lottery games dropped about 50%, prompting talk among lottery officials about jackpot fatigue.
 Sales of Mega Millions and Powerball continued to decline after the virus hit along with other lottery games, but while scratch tickets and other instant games rebounded strongly later in the year, national game sales remained moribund.
 In response to falling sales, officials updated the national games to reduce starting jackpots from $40 million to $20 million and changed rules about guaranteed minimum increases between drawings.
 The moves made fiscal sense but they caused jackpots to grow more slowly, further tamping down sales, as demonstrated by the record 37 draws without a winner it took to reach the current Mega Millions jackpot that's still far less than the all-time highs.
 ``That's why it takes so many rolls to get up to a high jackpot level,'' Medenica said.
 What hasn't changed are the odds.
 By design, Mega Millions and Powerball are relatively generous in awarding small dollar prizes and lottery officials boast there is a roughly one in 24 chance of winning something.
 But to generate huge jackpots, officials must be absolutely miserly about paying jackpots.
 It's hard to fathom how unlikely it is to beat odds of one in 292.
2 million for Powerball or one in 302.
5 million for Mega Millions.
 To get a sense of your chances, Steven Bleiler, a mathematics and statistics professor at Portland State University, said people should imagine a swimming pool 40 feet (12.
2 meters) wide, 120 feet (36.
6 meters) long and 5 feet (1.
5 meters) deep, filled to the brim with M&Ms, only one of which is green.
 To win, all a player must do is jump in blindfolded and wade around until finding that single green candy.
 Andrew Swift, a mathematics professor at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, put it this way: Your chances of picking up two oysters and finding a pearl in both is about twice as likely as winning either lottery jackpot.
 Still, someone always ultimately wins, and it happened again after Wednesday night's Powerball drawing when a single ticket sold at a convenience store in the small community of Lonaconing, Maryland, hit all six numbers.
 The winner can take a $716.
3 annuity paid over 30 years or a cash prize of $546.
8 million.
 What comes next is unclear.
 Some states are banking on growth in online games, but while the 10 states that allow purchases on computers and phone apps are seeing rising sales, such purchases remain a relatively small percentage of overall revenue.
 ``The current roll has revived the game as it's been designed,'' Medenica said.
 ``Whether we continue to consider making changes or not is to be seen.

PARIS: From crowing roosters to the whiff of barnyard animals, the "sensory heritage" of France's countryside will now be protected by law from attempts to stifle the everyday aspects of rural life from newcomers looking for peace and quiet.
 French senators on Thursday gave final approval to a law proposed in the wake of several high-profile conflicts by village residents and vacationers, or recent arrivals derided as "neo-rurals".
 A rowdy rooster named Maurice in particular made headlines in 2019 after a court in western France rejected a bid to have him silenced by neighbours who had purchased a holiday home nearby.
 "Living in the countryside implies accepting some nuisances," Joel Giraud, the government's minister in charge of rural life, told lawmakers.
 Cow bells (and cow droppings), grasshopper chirps and noisy early-morning tractors are also now considered part of France's natural heritage that will be codified in its environmental legislation.
 "It sends a strong message," said Pierre-Antoine Levi, the senator who acted as rapporteur for the bill.
 "It can act as a useful tool for local officials as they carry out their educational and mediation duties," he said.
 The law is emblematic of growing tensions in the countryside between longtime residents and outsiders whose bucolic expectations often clash with everyday realities.
 Corinne Fesseau and her rooster Maurice became the image of the fight when she was brought to court by pensioners next door over the animal's shrill wake-up calls.
 Critics saw the lawsuit as part of a broader threat to France's hallowed rural heritage by outsiders and city dwellers unable or unwilling to understand the realities of country life.
 Thousands of people signed a "Save Maurice" petition, and a judge eventually upheld the cock-a-doodle-doos.
 In another case from 2019, a woman in the duck-breeding heartland of the Landes region was brought to court by a newcomer neighbour fed up with the babbling of the ducks and geese in her back garden.
 A court in southwest France also threw out that case.

NEW YORK: Indian-American Rahul Dubey, who had opened the doors of his Washington DC home to over 70 people demonstrating against the killing of George Floyd, has been hailed among the "Heroes of 2020" by the TIME magazine, honouring those who "went above and beyond the call of duty" this year.
  In the 'Heroes of 2020', the publication also named Australia's volunteer firefighters who risked everything to keep their country safe, food-stall owners Jason Chua and Hung Zhen Long in Singapore who wouldn't let anyone go hungry during the Covid-19 pandemic, Pastor Reshorna Fitzpatrick and her husband Bishop Derrick Fitzpatrick of Chicago, who transformed their church to support their community during the trying year.
  A newspaper deliveryman Greg Dailey, who began a grocery drop-off service in mid-March to anyone in need along his paper route and has since supplied more than 140 homes and conducted over 1,000 grocery runs in New Jersey's Mercer county, was also named by the magazine.
  "From citizens providing food and shelter to those in need to volunteers who protected their neighbours from natural disasters, these heroes went above and beyond the call of duty in 2020," TIME said.
  TIME described Dubey as "The Man Who Gave Shelter to Those in Need.
"  On June 1, as demonstrators filled the streets of Washington DC to protest the killing of African-American Floyd, Dubey was home, not far from the White House.
  After a 7 PM curfew, he noticed crowds in the street outside as "police had set up barricades seemingly to trap protesters, and were pepper-spraying those who remained.
 Dubey decided to take action," TIME said.
  "I open my door, and I start yelling, 'Get in!'" says Dubey, who works in the health care sector.
 "All these people were swarming in.
"  Dubey said he gave about 70 protesters refuge in his home, housing them overnight to avoid curfew breaches.
  "People were coughing, crying, strangers pouring milk into strangers' eyes," Dubey said.
  "They were sharing information, writing down numbers for bail bondsmen.
 It was this real camaraderie.
"  A report in TIME said Dubey claims police officers made several attempts to breach his sanctuary that evening: posing as protesters trying to get inside, and attempting to intercept the pizza delivery he had ordered for his houseguests.
  The move to open his door was driven by instinct, Dubey says nearly six months later.
 "It's what was needed.
"  For his act, Dubey had been hailed as a hero and saviour as those who took shelter in his house started tweeting about it.
  "Rahul saved lives last night," one Black Lives Matter activist had written on Twitter.
  "He ended this with an inspirational speech about not giving up and keeping up the peaceful fight.
 What a guy.
 Thank you, Rahul.
"  Dubey had told BuzzFeed News that it wasn't a choice to open his door and provide refuge to the mostly young protesters.
  "If you had seen what was going on in front of my eyes, there was no choice.
 People were getting pepper-sprayed and beaten and slammed to the ground," he had told the media outlet.
  "I hope that my 13-year-old son grows up to be just as amazing as they are," Dubey was quoted as saying by WJLA news.
  Floyd, 46, died in Minneapolis on May 25 when a white police officer pinned him to the ground and knelt on his neck as he gasped for breath.
  The footage, which went viral, showed Floyd pleading with the officer, saying he can't breathe.
 The four police officers seen in the footage have since been charged.
  His death triggered nationwide violent protests with a section of the protesters resorting to looting and rioting across the country, leaving behind a trail of destruction.

WASHINGTON: Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has been elected as the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), making her one of the most powerful US lawmakers in the 117th Congress.
 Jayapal, 55, who was elected on Wednesday, said that the caucus is going to advance racial justice, tackle poverty and inequality and help transform the country.
 "As a lifelong organiser, I am honoured that my colleagues have elected me to lead the Congressional Progressive Caucus at this pivotal moment," Jayapal said soon after her election to this most powerful Congressional Caucus, which is slated to play an influential role during the next Biden Administration.
 Joe Biden, 78, is due to take over as the 46th president of the US on January 20.
 "We have massive crises knocking at our nation's door, and the work of the Progressive Caucus has never been more important.
 The American people need Congress to lead with vision, conviction, empathy, and dedication to people and families in every community who are struggling right now," said Jayapal.
 The incoming Executive Board of CPC is made up of 26 members - one Chair, one Deputy Chair, one Whip, two Chair Emeriti, two Special Order Hour Conveners, ten Vice Chairs, one Executive Board Member At-Large and eight Deputy Whips.
 The CPC Executive Board is representative of the diversity within the caucus - more than half of Executive Board members are people of colour and more than half are women.
 Incoming CPC Deputy Chair Congresswoman Katie Porter said that in 2018, many of her Democratic colleagues and she successfully ran campaigns rooted in progressive values.
 "Rather than shying away from our core principles, we embraced them- making it clear that a progressive agenda is not only the right policy for America, but also a winning political message," she said.
 CPC Whip Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said, "we have a unique opportunity to fight for transformative change in the 117th Congress- whether that is addressing the coronavirus pandemic, passing universal healthcare, tackling the climate crisis or reorienting our foreign policy.
" "I look forward to continuing to represent my colleagues in building an effect progressive voting bloc in Congress alongside fearless leaders like Reps.
 Pramila Jayapal and Katie," she said.
 Among others, Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna has been elected as Deputy Whip, while Congresswoman Rashida Talib as vice chair for member services.
 "We have massive crises knocking at our nation's door and our work has never been more important.
 It's time for Congress to act boldly and restore power to where it belongs: with the people," Jayapal said in a tweet.
 "Together, our caucus is going to deliver real relief to families, advance racial justice, tackle poverty and inequality, champion climate justice, and help transform this country so working people can finally get ahead.
 Let's get to work," Jayapal said.

LONDON: An 87-year-old man and his 83-year-old wife from the north east of England on Tuesday became the first Indian-origin couple in the world to get a vaccine against Covid-19, after they got injected with their first of two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab at a hospital in Newcastle.
 Dr Hari Shukla, a race relations campaigner based in Tyne and Wear, had been contacted by the National Health Service (NHS) based on the criteria set for the world's first vaccine to receive regulatory approvals in the UK last week.
 His wife, Ranjan, then volunteered for the jab as she also falls within the first phase of people aged 80 and over, care home workers as well as NHS workers at high risk eligible to receive the "life-saving jab".
 "Hari Shukla and his wife Ranjan have become the first two patients at Newcastle Hospitals ' and two of the first people in the world ' to receive the Covid-19 vaccine," Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said.
 They join 90-year-old Margaret "Maggie" Keenan from Coventry as the very first in the world to receive her shot, followed by 81-year-old William Shakespeare in Warwickshire as the second.
 "I'm so pleased we are hopefully coming towards the end of this pandemic and I am delighted to be doing my bit by having the vaccine, I feel it is my duty to do so and do whatever I can to help," said Shukla, who was born in Kenya and whose father hailed from Mumbai.
 "Having been in contact with the NHS [National Health Service], I know how hard they all work and the greatest respect for them ' they have a heart of gold and I am grateful for everything they have done to keep us safe during the pandemic," he said.
 Shukla, who has been honoured with an MBE, OBE and CBE for his work as the Director of the Tyne and Wear Race Equality Council over the years, was notified by the NHS based on the criteria set by the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as part of a phased rollout plan based on those at the highest risk of death from the deadly virus.
 "Today marks a huge step forward in the UK's fight against coronavirus, as we begin delivering the vaccine to the first patients across the whole country.
 I am immensely proud of the scientists who developed the vaccine, members of the public who took part in trials, and the NHS who have worked tirelessly to prepare for rollout,' said British Prime Minister Prime Johnson.
 However, he struck a note of caution to warn that mass vaccination will take time and urged the public to remain "clear-eyed" and continue to follow the lockdown rules over the winter months ahead.
 The NHS said it is undertaking the biggest and most highly anticipated immunisation campaign in history at 50 hospital hubs, with more starting vaccinations over the coming weeks and months as the programme ramps up after the first set of doses arrived from Pfizer's manufacturing site in Belgium.
 "We will look back on today, V-day, as a key moment in our fight back against this terrible disease, and I am proud our health services across the United Kingdom are about to embark on our largest ever vaccination programme,' said Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who got teary eyed during television interviews on Tuesday as he declared he felt "proud to be British".
 Since the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine got the green light from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) last week, the NHS said its workers have been working around the clock to manage the large-scale logistical challenge of deploying the vaccine.
 "Coronavirus is the greatest health challenge in NHS history, taking loved ones from us and disrupting every part of our lives," said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Executive.
 "The deployment of this vaccine marks a decisive turning point in the battle with the pandemic.
 NHS vaccination programmes which have successfully helped overcome tuberculosis, polio, and smallpox, now turn their focus to coronavirus.
 NHS staff are proud to be leading the way as the first health service in the world to begin vaccination with this Covid jab," he said.
 The MHRA has stressed that the vaccine has been cleared for mass rollout only after "rigorous" safety tests despite the process being speeded up due to the urgency of finding an effective vaccine against a pandemic which has wreaked havoc around the world.
 NHS national medical director, Professor Stephen Powis, has warned that the roll out of a vaccine will be a "marathon" not a sprint.
 The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at -70C before being thawed out and can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used.
 General Practitioners (GPs) and other primary care staff have also been put on standby to start delivering the jab on a phased basis.
 Vaccination centres treating large numbers of patients in sporting venues and conference centres will subsequently start up when further supplies of vaccine come on stream, with a bulk of the rollout expected in the early part of the New Year.

UK: Johnson backs Priti Patel after probe declares her 'bully'

TEXT:
LONDON: UK PM Boris Johnson on Friday backed Priti Patel, one of his most senior ministers, after a damning inquiry into allegations that she bullied her staff concluded she had broken rules, including shouting and swearing at them.
 Johnson's defence of the Indian-origin home secretary prompted the author of the report, independent adviser Alex Allan, to resign.
 Patel had not met the standards set under Britain's ministerial code which states ministers should treat officials with respect, Allan had concluded.
 Ministers usually step down if they are found to be in breach of the code.
 However, a government statement said Johnson judged the code had not been breached, saying that concerns had not been raised at the time and that Patel was unaware of the impact of her actions.
 "The PM has full confidence in home secretary and considers this matter now closed," it said.
 Patel had been accused of demeaning her staff, prompting Johnson to launch an inquiry in March to establish the facts.
 In a summary of his advice, Allan found that Patel had become "justifiably in many instances" frustrated by her department's lack of support, and this had "manifested itself in forceful expression, including some occasions of shouting and swearing".
 "Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying.
.
.
," Allan's advice said.
 Patel thanked PM for his support and said, "I am sorry that my behaviour in the past has upset people.
 I acknowledge that I have at times got frustrated.
" Colleagues rallied round her, describing her as kind.
 However, Keir Starmer, the leader of Labour Party, said he would have sacked her.
 Patel had to quit as aid minister in 2017 because she held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials.
